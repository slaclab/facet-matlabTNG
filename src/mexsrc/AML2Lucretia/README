AML2Lucretia is a Matlab mex function used to convert an AML lattice to Lucretia format.

It is primarily intended for use with the Floodland Flight Simulator environment at ATF2,
and, as such, will make certain assumptions about the contents of the AML file.  This is
necessary since AML is such a flexible format, that it is not possible (given my time and
salary) to code up a converter that can deal with any and all legal AML syntax.

At the moment these routines are appalling "alpha" in nature, and SHOULD NOT BE USED BY
ANYONE AT ANY TIME FOR ANY PURPOSE.

USE OF THESE ROUTINES ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE FEVER, NAUSEA, HALITOSIS, ERECTILE DYSFUNTION,
MALE-PATTERN BALDING, LOSS OF BLADDER CONTROL, GLOBAL WARMING, LIVER SPOTS, URBAN DECAY,
ACID RAIN, DISAPPEARANCE OF HONEY BEES, AND AN INEXPLICABLE FANATICISM FOR THE MUSIC OF MC HAMMER.

You have been warned.

Stop.  Hammer time.
