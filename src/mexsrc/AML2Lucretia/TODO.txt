1/ Extract orientation information and add this to BEAMLINE{}.Offset.
This needs to be done for all types of element.

2/ Search for the presence of an instrument at each element, and make a BPM
if necessary.

3/ Fix the "type 3" corrector structure.

4/ GIRDERs are in there now, but I haven't done anything to extract their
orientation yet.
