% Lucretia status and messages:
%
% Lucretia functions return status and messages in a cell array.  The first
% cell in the array is a numeric status value, set to +1 if the function
% executed successfully and various other values if an error or warning
% condition occurred during execution.  Subsequent cells in the status
% array are text messages generated during execution.
