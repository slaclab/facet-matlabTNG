function out = jetvar(m)

% JETVAR Variant of Jet colormap.
% 
% Usage: OUT = JETVAR(M)
% 
% This returns an M-by-3 matrix containing a variant of the Jet colormap.
% Instead of starting at dark blue as Jet does, it starts at white. It goes
% to pure blue from white, and then continues exactly as Jet does, ranging
% through shades blue, cyan, green, yellow, and red, and ending with dark
% red. M should be at least 10 to ensure there is at least one white color.
% 
% Inputs:
%   -M: Length of colormap (optional, default is the length of the current
%   figure's colormap).
% 
% Outputs:
%   -OUT: M-by-3 colormap.
% 
% See also: JET, HSV, HOT, PINK, FLAG, COLORMAP, RGBPLOT.
