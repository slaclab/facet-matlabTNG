<small>Field Map Proposal and Specifications<br>
<br>
</small></span></div>
The use of arbitrary field maps, which can be superimposed over
beamline elements, has been proposed as a reasonably elegant technique
which would allow Lucretia to simulate a wide variety of unusual
conditions or systems which would otherwise be difficult to
manage.&nbsp; Examples include the coupler kicks of an RF cavity,
solenoids or quads which are wrapped around an RF cavity, or an IR
solenoid wrapped around the IR quads and other elements.<br>
<br>
On this page we attempt to collect the specifications and requirements
for adding field maps to Lucretia.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
Management and Other General Issues</span><br>
</div>
<br>
The Lucretia representation of a field map will be in a new global data
array, FIELDMAP.&nbsp; Each FIELDMAP entry will be a data structure
with the following fields:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Element:&nbsp; # of the element in BEAMLINE which this field map
is superimposed upon.</li>
  <li>dS:&nbsp; S position offset between the upstream face of the
element and the kick center of the field map.</li>
  <li>Class:&nbsp; can be "AC" or "DC".<br>
  </li>
  <li>Lrad:&nbsp; Longitudinal extent of the field map, used for
tracking with synchrotron radiation (DC maps only).</li>
  <li>Offset:&nbsp; 1 x 6 vector of field map offsets [x, xang, y,
yang, z, roll].</li>
  <li>Girder:&nbsp; Index # of the girder which supports the field map.</li>
  <li>PS:&nbsp; Index # of the power supply which excites the field map
(DC maps only).</li>
  <li>Klystron:&nbsp; Index # of the klystron which excites the field
map (AC maps only).</li>
  <li>Freq:&nbsp; frequency of the field map (AC maps only).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Phase:&nbsp; phase of the field map (AC maps only).</li>
  <li>x:&nbsp; 1 x N vector of horizontal coordinates.</li>
  <li>y:&nbsp; M x 1 vector of vertical coordinates.</li>
  <li>Ex, Ey, Es, Bx, By, Bs:&nbsp; M x N matrices of electric /
magnetic fields in the map, at the (x,y) coordinate specified by the x
and y vectors.&nbsp; E values are in MV, B values in T.m.<br>
  </li>
  <li>TrackFlag:&nbsp; data structure of tracking flags.&nbsp; At this
time, only one tracking flag is foreseen:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>SynRad:&nbsp; selects whether incoherent emission of
synchrotron radiation is enabled (1) or disabled (0).&nbsp; The value
of SynRad in the field map must match the SynRad value in the element's
TrackFlag structure, if the element has such a flag at all.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>do we need any kind of errors for the field map?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
It is clear that there are some fields which are only relelvant for AC
field maps, some which are only relevant for DC maps, and some which
are relevant for either type.&nbsp; The bookkeeping can be taken care
of by making FIELDMAP an array of data structures, in which each array
member has all the fields for either AC or DC, but the fields which are
not relevant for the particular map are zero.&nbsp; Alternately (my
preference), FIELDMAP can be a cell array, and each cell can be either
an AC map or a DC map, and would only have the relevant fields for the
correct type.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The data structures BEAMLINE, GIRDER, KLYSTRON, and PS would be
expanded to include FieldMap fields, which contain the numbers of the
field maps which are connected to the element, girder, klystron, or
power supply.&nbsp; Each field map can be associated with at most one
element, girder, klystron, or power supply; each element, girder,
klystron, or power supply can have an unlimited number of field
maps.&nbsp; The field maps which are pointed to by an element need not
be in any particular order (ie, the BEAMLINE{}.FieldMap vector need not
be sorted by S position, nor by index into FIELDMAP; the field maps in
FIELDMAP need not be sorted by S position or even by element).&nbsp; It
may be desirable to expand the TrackFlag structure of the elements to
have a FieldMap flag, which indicates whether field maps are to be used
in the tracking.<br>
<br>
Elements of Class MARK and COORD may not be associated with any field
maps.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lattice
Verification</span><br>
</div>
<br>
The lattice verification process (VerifyLattice) must be expanded to
perform checkout of the FIELDMAP data structures. The checkout must
include the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Consistency between FIELDMAP and BEAMLINE, GIRDER, KLYSTRON, PS
arrays:&nbsp; all cross-referencing is correct:&nbsp; if a field map
points to an element, the element points back at the field map, etc.</li>
  <li>No element points at a field map index past the end of the
FIELDMAP array.</li>
  <li>No field map points at an element, girder, klystron, or power
supply which is past the end of those arrays.<br>
  </li>
  <li>All necessary fields are present for either an AC or a DC field
map, and have the correct sizes.</li>
  <li>A map associated with a cavity is AC, otherwise it's DC.</li>
  <li>The sizes of the E and B matrices are consistent with the sizes
of x and y vectors.</li>
  <li>The SynRad track flag of the field map and its element are
consistent with one another.</li>
  <li>The field map does not point to an invalid element class (COORD
or MARK).</li>
  <li>The field map does not extend past the end of the element, taking
the Lrad into account (ie, dS+/- Lrad/2 is neither &lt; 0 nor &gt; the
length of the element).</li>
  <li>The field maps on a given element do not overlap each other,
taking their Lrad values into account (ie, when considering neighboring
field maps on an&nbsp; element, ds(first)+Lrad(first)/2 &lt;
ds(second)-Lrad(second)/2).</li>
  <li>If SynRad &gt; 0, then Lrad ~= 0 as well (ie, no synchrotron
radiation from an element with zero Lrad!).</li>
  <li>Anything I've forgotten?</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation
within Mexfiles</span><br>
</div>
<br>
The GetRmats, RmatAtoB, and GetTwiss mexfiles ignore the field maps
completely -- their operation is the same as it is now.<br>
<br>
For tracking, any element with field maps must be divided into
longitudinal slices between the map locations.&nbsp; In the element
segments, regular element tracking is performed.&nbsp; At the field map
locations, the field values at the location of each particle are
estimated by using the interp2 matlab function, and applied to the
particle in a thin-kick method.&nbsp; If the particle lies outside the
area specified by the x and y vectors, an extrapolation value of zero
is used and a warning is sent to the status cell array (ie, a text
message and a -1 status).&nbsp; After each slice of the element and
each field map, the tests for a stopped particle (due to transverse
momentum &gt; 1 or total momentum &lt; 0) must be executed.<br>
<br>
During tracking, all of the bad conditions which are listed in Lattice
Verification must be tested for.&nbsp; If any such bad condition
exists, tracking should immediately halt and return to the Matlab
prompt, setting stat{1} to zero and putting an appropriate complaint
into the stat message stack.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Since synchrotron radiation emission is a nonlinear function of
magnetic field, the field of the magnet and of the field map must be
combined to compute the SR emission correctly.&nbsp; In regions where
there is no overlapping field map, the SR calculation must use only the
element's field.&nbsp; To do this right, it will probably be necessary
for the length of an element segment for tracking purposes to be
different from its length for synchrotron radiation calculations!<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">M-file
modifications</span><br>
</div>
<br>
The following M-file additions or changes must be made:<br>
<ul>
  <li>One or more m-files for instantiating field map data structures
must be written.</li>
  <li>Tools for creating the cross-referencing between a field map and
an element, field map and girder, field map and klystron, field map and
power supply must be written.&nbsp; This includes eliminating that
cross-reference (ie, removing a field map from an element, etc).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The momentum profile management tools must add an option to scale
a field map's strength when the field map's element is scaled.</li>
  <li>Field map display tools must be added to the BeamlineViewer.</li>
  <li>If we decide to allow field maps to have offsets and errors, we
need to add field map support to the offsets and errors tools.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
