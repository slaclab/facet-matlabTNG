<small>Representation of the Beam<br>
<br>
</small></span>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
Lucretia uses a Matlab data structure to represent a beam to be tracked
through the lattice.&nbsp; Each beam can have one bunch or a train of
bunches; each bunch can have one ray which is to be tracked, or more
than one; bunches within a beam can have different numbers of rays,
different charges per ray, different charges per bunch.&nbsp; The
fields of the beam structure are as follows:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BunchInterval:</span>&nbsp; the time
interval between bunches in the beam, in seconds.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bunch:</span>&nbsp; A structure array
containing information on the rays in each bunch of the beam (so, for
example, if you have beam structure MyBeam, the information on rays in
bunch 1 is in MyBeam.Bunch(1), bunch 2 is MyBeam.Bunch(2), etc).&nbsp;
The fields of the Bunch structure are as follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span>&nbsp;
charge of each ray in coulombs.&nbsp; This is a 1 x nray row-vector.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">stop<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span></span>&nbsp;
the index into BEAMLINE of the element at which the ray was
stopped.&nbsp; MyBeam.Bunch(bunchno).stop(rayno) == 0 for a ray which
has not been stopped (ie, hasn't hit an aperture, been decelerated to
rest in the lab frame, or been deflected by &gt; 90 degrees wrt the
accelerator axis), so this is the normal state of a ray.&nbsp; If a ray
meets the stopping conditions listed above at some point during
tracking, its value of stop is set to the index of the element and its
coordinates are frozen at their values at the moment the ray was
stopped.&nbsp; This is a 1 x nray row-vector.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">x:</span>&nbsp; the 6-dimensional
coordinates of the ray.&nbsp; The coordinates in order are:&nbsp;
horizontal position [m]; horizontal component of transverse momentum,
normalized to the ray's total momentum [radians]; vertical position and
normalized momentum ([m] and [rad], respectively); arrival time wrt
reference particle * the speed of light [m]; total momentum
[GeV/c].&nbsp; MyBeam.Bunch(bunchno).x is a 6 x nray matrix, so the
coordinates of a given ray are a column vector,
MyBeam.Bunch(bunchno).x(1:6,rayno).<br>
<br>
</div>
A few things to note about the ray coordinates used for tracking:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The transverse momentum coordinates are not the same as those
used in MAD.&nbsp; MAD uses the transverse momenta normalized to the
design or reference momentum; Lucretia uses the transverse momenta
normalized to the actual total momenum of the given ray.&nbsp; In other
words, px[Lucretia] = px[MAD] / (1+delta[MAD]).</li>
  <li>The transverse momentum coordinate is also not the same as the x'
coordinate used in TRANSPORT, DIMAD, and LIAR, although it's
close.&nbsp; For a particle whose trajectory makes an angle theta wrt
the nominal, the TRANSPORT x' = tan(theta), while Lucretia's px =
sin(theta).&nbsp; In the paraxial approximation these two are very
nearly equal; outside of that approximation none of the codes listed
above is to be trusted in any case.</li>
  <li>The longitudinal position / arrival time coordinate is defined
such that z &lt; 0 particles arrive first, ie they are in the "head"
while z&gt;0 particles are in the "tail."&nbsp; This is the same as the
TRANSPORT, DIMAD, and LIAR conventions and the opposite of the MAD and
MERLIN conventions.</li>
  <li>Note that coordinate 6 is the actual total momentum of the ray
rather than its offset wrt the design or nominal momentum.&nbsp;
Lucretia doesn't really have a concept of "design momentum" -- magnet
strengths are stored in magnetic field units (ie, B values and not K
values), and rays are represented with momentum units [GeV/c] and not a
dimensionless offset.&nbsp; For beamlines which have a nonzero design
energy gain, this is a more convenient method of accounting for
momentum variation than the typical reference momentum / delta
methodology.</li>
  <li>Because x(6,:) is the total momentum, a zero value for this
coordinate represents a ray which has decelerated to rest in the lab
frame, and is stopped.&nbsp; This is different from most codes, in
which coordinates [0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0] represent an "ideal" particle
on the reference trajectory; in Lucretia these coordinates represent a
ray which has stopped dead and will no longer be tracked.</li>
</ul>
The function <a href="beam_generation.html#CreateBlankBeam">CreateBlankBeam</a> can be
used to generate a proper data structure for a beam with a desired
number of rays, etc.&nbsp; Other functions for this sort of purpose are
discussed on the <a href="beam_generation.html">beam generation</a> page.<br>
