Often the best way to learn a new simulation code is to start from an
example or two; this will also help to indicate whether the code is
working or not.&nbsp; At the moment there are 3 Lucretia examples
available, and they are included in the Lucretia Zip files (see <a
 href="downloads.html">downloads</a>), or the source code of the
examples can be browsed (follow the links in the example names).<br>
<br>
<a
 href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/ilc/codes/Lucretia/src/Examples/Tutorial/"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tutorial:</span></a>&nbsp; this example
starts by generating a simple lattice (a linac with 10 FODO cells plus
a 4 bend chicane at the end) and uses it to demonstrate many of
Lucretia's most interesting features and functions.&nbsp; Users should
feel free to insert "return" statements into the master file
(LucretiaTutorial.m) in various places, and at those locations use the
BeamlineViewer GUI to explore the state of the beamline.&nbsp;
Hopefully this is a good entry point for general use of Lucretia.<br>
<br>
Approximate execution time:&nbsp; 3 minutes on a 2 GHz WinXP laptop,
most of which is taken up by a tracking example of 1000 bunches with
long-range wakefields turned on...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; both examples below
need
the XSIF parser library for Matlab, which is available from the <a
 href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page.<br>

BC</a>:&nbsp; </span>A "straw man"
single-stage BC + main linac.&nbsp; After instantiation the example
will generate Twiss parameters, track bunches on-axis and with a 1
sigma_y initial offset, examine the longitudinal phase space variation
as the BC RF phase is varied, and do some simple studies of transverse
sensitivities to misalignments.&nbsp; Finally, a bunch train (with 1
ray/bunch) is tracked through the linac with LRWFs, including rotations
and mode-splittings.<br>
<br>
This example shows how to use deck parsing, deck verification, Twiss
and Rmat calculation, single and multibunch tracking, bunch
compression, acceleration, and focusing, BPM data, single-bunch and
multi-bunch wakefields, and a variety of analysis tools.&nbsp; It also
shows the use of a "rich" lattice (ie, one with all the girders, power
supplies, and klystrons defined).<br>
<br>
Approximate execution time:&nbsp; 19 minutes on a 1 GHz WinXP laptop.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/ilc/codes/Lucretia/src/Examples/NLCFF/">NLC
FF</a>:</span>&nbsp; After
instantiation the example will generate Twiss parameters, track a bunch
on-axis, and study the performance of the NLC-FF as a function of beam
centroid energy.<br>
<br>
This example shows how to use sextupoles, octupoles, and higher-order
multipoles.&nbsp; It also shows the use of a lattice without girders,
power supplies, or klystrons (which is somewhat less fun and doesn't
engage the full utility of Lucretia but can be faster to set up, and
really, sometimes the BEAMLINE is all you need).<br>
<br>
Approximate execution time:&nbsp; 95 seconds on a 1 GHz WinXP
workstation.<br>
