<div style="text-align: left;">Lucretia supports three types of beam
instrumentation:&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>standard beamline <a href="element_classes.html#BPM">BPM</a>s,
with class HMON, VMON, or MONI;</li>
  <li>other forms of standard <a href="element_classes.html#INST">instrumentation</a>
with class INST, PROF, WIRE, BLMO, SLMO, IMON</li>
  <li>higher-order mode BPMs in <a href="element_classes.html#LCAV">LCAV</a>s.</li>
</ul>
When one or more bunches are tracked through an element with one of the
classes listed above, the tracker can generate simulated instrument
data for that element which is then returned to the user.&nbsp; In
addition, depending on the options, HMON, VMON, and MONI elements can
generate additional information which would not under ordinary
circumstances be available at a real BPM.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Selecting Devices to Return Data</big><br>
</div>
<br>
The selection of devices which will return data is accomplished with
tracking flags:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Any BPM for which the GetBPMData flag is set to zero returns no
BPM readings; if the flag is set to 1, BPM readings are returned.</li>
  <li>Any BPM for which the GetBPMBeamPars flag is set to zero will not
return any additional information on the beam distribution; if the flag
is set to 1, additional information will be returned.</li>
  <li>Any instrument for which the GetInstData flag is set to zero will
not return any readings; if the flag is set to 1, instrument readings
will be returned.</li>
  <li>Any LCAV for which the GetSBPMData flag is set to zero will not
return any HOM BPM readings; if the flag is set to 1, all HOM BPMs on
the given LCAV will return position data.</li>
  <li>BPMs and instruments also have a MultiBunch flag:&nbsp; setting
MultiBunch == 0 causes the device to return data for all tracked
bunches as an aggregate, whereas setting MultiBunch == 1 causes
readings for each individual bunch to be returned.&nbsp; The HOM BPMs
do not have this option; they always return readings for all the
tracked bunches as an aggregate.&nbsp; Note that by "tracked bunches" I
mean "bunches tracked in a given call to TrackThru."&nbsp; At the end
of execution TrackThru returns any data which was requested and deletes
it from its internal buffers, so if you track bunch 1 of a beam, return
to the Matlab prompt, and then track bunch 2, the readings at the end
of the second bunch tracking will never aggregate bunches 1 and
2.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
One benefit of selecting and deselecting devices which are to return
information to the user is that reducing the number of devices which
return data improves execution speed.&nbsp; In my experience the factor
of improvement is not huge, but you may find it worthwhile to limit BPM
and instrument use to just those which you really care about at the
moment.&nbsp; A much more important factor (to me) is that limiting the
number of devices which return data can help prevent you from drowning
in the stuff.&nbsp; A linear collider can have 10,000 RF structures per
side, and each of those can have one or more HOM BPM; that kind of data
volume can beome a headache...<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Format of Returned Data<big><br>
</big></big></div>
<br>
All BPMs, instruments, and HOM BPMs return their readings in the third
return argument of TrackThru:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beam2,readings] = TrackThru(elem1,elem2,
beam1, bunch1, bunch2, 0) ;<br>
<br>
argument readings is a 1 x 3 cell array of instrument data.&nbsp; Note
that TrackThru can be called with only 2 return arguments:&nbsp; in
this case, if there is no third return argument for TrackThru, tracking
will proceed as though all instrument data flags were set to
zero.&nbsp; This is a simpler way to suppress all instrument data than
changing all the actual flag values throughout BEAMLINE.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BPMs:&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
Cell 1 of readings is a data structure full of BPM information; the
correct notation for accessing this is readings{1}(1), readings{1}(2),
etc.&nbsp; The fields in the structure are as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Index:</span>&nbsp; pointer into
the BEAMLINE cell array position of the BPM.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">S:</span>&nbsp; S position of
the BPM.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pmod:</span>&nbsp; design
centroid momentum at the BPM.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">x:</span>&nbsp; horizontal
position reading</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">y:</span>&nbsp; vertical
position reading.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">z:</span>&nbsp; arrival time at
BPM * c.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">P:</span>&nbsp; actual centroid
momentum at the BPM.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">sigma:</span>&nbsp; matrix of
second moments at the BPM.</li>
</ul>
The BPM data structure only has values for BPMs which had their data
collection tracking flags set; there are not "blank" entries for BPMs
which had their collection flags turned off (ie, if BPMs 1 and 3 have
GetBPMData == 1 but BPM 2 has GetBPMData == 0, there will be 2 entries
in readings{1}, where readings{1}(1) has BPM 1 returned values and
readings{1}(2) has BPM 3 returned values).&nbsp; The Index, S, Pmod, x,
and y fields are filled for all BPMs with either GetBPMData or
GetBPMBeamPars set to 1.&nbsp; If GetBPMBeamPars is set to zero, the z,
P, and sigma fields will be present but blank.<br>
<br>
For BPMs with MultiBunch == 0, fields x, y, z, and P are scalars, sigma
is a 6 x 6 matrix.&nbsp; If MultiBunch == 1, fields x, y, z, and P are
1 x nbunch vectors, and sigma is a 6 x 6 x nbunch matrix.<br>
