<br>
</small></span></div>
Lucretia uses a specialized data structure called an <span
 style="font-style: italic;">error group</span> to manage its errors
and misalignments.&nbsp; An error group, as the name suggests, is a
collection of elements, slices, or blocks which will have errors and
misalignments applied to them.&nbsp; Consider for example the case of
the International Linear Collider:&nbsp; the magnets in the linac are
superconducting magnets which share a common cryostat with several
accelerating structures, while the beam delivery system magnets are
almost all room-temperature iron-dominated magnets.&nbsp; It is likely
that the misalignments of the linac magnets can be represented by a
Gaussian distribution of some width, while the beam delivery system
magnet misalignments can be represented by a Gaussian distribution of a
different width.&nbsp; Ensuring that all the linac magnets get one
distribution of errors, while all the BDS magnets get a different one,
can be achieved by defining an error group for the linac magnets and a
different error group for the BDS magnets.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeErrorGroup"></a>MakeErrorGroup:</span><br>
<br>
Define an error group.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat, group] =
MakeErrorGroup( table, range, errorname, use_sliceblock, comment )<br>
<br>
selects a subset of the members of a data structure to be part of the
error group.&nbsp; Arguments are as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>table:&nbsp; either a string or a cell array of strings.&nbsp;
The first string must be the name of the Lucretia data strucutre which
has the members of the error group, and can be 'BEAMLINE', 'KLYSTRON',
'PS', or 'GIRDER'.&nbsp; If table{1} == 'BEAMLINE', then table{2} and
table{3} are optional parameters which allow selection of only certain
classes or certain named elements.&nbsp; For example, if table{2} ==
'LCAV' then only RF structures will be included in the error group; if
table{2} == 'LCAV' and table{3} == 'LCAV01' then only RF structures
named 'LCAV01' will be included.&nbsp; Multiple classes can be included
in one error group by using a cell array of class names for Table{2}
(ie, if Table{2} == {'LCAV' , 'TCAV'} then the error group will include
both accelerating structures and deflecting structures).&nbsp;
Similarly, if Table{3} is a cell array of element names, then multiple
element names can be included in the error group.&nbsp; Finally, the
names in Table{3} can be Matlab regular expressions, in which case all
the elements with names which fit the expression will be included.<br>
  </li>
  <li>range:&nbsp; a 1 x 2 vector with the starting and ending index
values of the error group members in the table.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>errorname:&nbsp; name of a valid error for the group, which is
'Offset' for GIRDERs, 'dAmpl' or 'dPhase' for KLYSTRONs, 'dAmpl' for
PS's, 'dB', 'dB(1)', 'dB(2)', or 'Offset' for magnet members of
BEAMLINE, 'dV', 'dPhase',
'Offset', or 'BPMOffset' for LCAV members of BEAMLINE, 'dScale',
'Offset' or
'ElecOffset' for BPM members of BEAMLINE, and 'Offset' for instrument
members of BEAMLINE.<br>
  </li>
  <li>use_sliceblock:&nbsp; if this scalar == 0, then slices and blocks
will be ignored when applying errors (ie, each entry in BEAMLINE can
potentially get unique errors).&nbsp; If use_sliceblock == 2, then
slices and blocks will be respected when applying errors.&nbsp; If
use_sliceblock == 1, then slices and blocks will be respected, BUT only
elements in the slice/block which have the class and/or name selected
by table{2} and/or table{3} will be respected.&nbsp; This last is the
option to use if, for example, you have blocks which contain quads and
captive BPMs and you want to misalign the quads in a block but not
misalign the BPMs with them.</li>
  <li>comment:&nbsp; a text string which is attached to the resulting
error group.</li>
</ul>
Return variable group is the error group:&nbsp; it includes the
requested comment, a list of data entries which are to have errors
applied to them (including any slice/block correlations that must be
respected), and text instructions which can be used to apply the errors
(via the Matlab feval statement).&nbsp; Possible returned status values
include stat{1} == 1 indicating success, or stat{1} == 0 if an invalid
combination of arguments is supplied (asking for dV on magnets, for
example).<br>
<br>
Most elements in BEAMLINE will have a scalar dB, while others
(specifically certain gradient bends) can have a dB which is 1 x
2.&nbsp; An error group which uses 'dB' for its error name will ignore
any device with a 1 x 2 dB data slot; similarly, specifying 'dB(1)' or
'dB(2)' for the error name will cause MakeErrorGroup to generate an
error group in which any element with a scalar dB is ignored.<br>
<br>
What do you do when you've got an error group? You apply errors to it!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ErrorGroupGaussErrors"></a>ErrorGroupGaussErrors:</span><br>
<br>
Apply Gaussian-distributed errors to the members of an error group.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,error_values] =
ErrorGroupGaussErrors( group, meanvalue, rmsvalue, keepoldvalue )<br>
<br>
applies the requested distribution of errors to the members of the
group.&nbsp; Argument meanvalue is the requested mean of the
distribution, rmsvalue is the standard deviation of the distribution,
and keepoldvalue indicates that existing errors should be discarded
(keepoldvalue == 0) or kept and added to (keepoldvalue == 1).&nbsp; The
arguments meanvalue, rmsvalue, keepoldvalue are all scalars for dAmpl,
dPhase, dV, dB errors; they are all 1 x 2 vectors for BPMOffset and
ElecOffset errors ; and they are 1 x 6 for Offset errors.<br>
<br>
Returned variable error_values contains several fields:&nbsp; The mean
and RMS of the applied
values, which have the same dimensions as meanvalue, rmsvalue, and
keepoldvalue; the applied (new) errors, which have nError rows and the
same number of columns as meanvalue, rmsvalue, and keepoldvalue; and
the total errors, including old errors which were kept, which has the
same dimensions as the matrix of new errors.&nbsp; Possible return
status values are stat{1} == +1 for
success, and stat{1} == 0 for invalid arguments (inconsistent and/or
wrong lengths, etc).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SetGaussianErrors"></a>SetGaussianErrors:</span><br>
<br>
Apply gaussian errors to the lattice, and no tricks!<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">[stat, error_values] =
SetGaussianErrors( table, range, meanvalue, rmsvalue, errorname,
use_sliceblock, keepoldvalue )<br>
</div>
<br>
simply executes <a href="#MakeErrorGroup">MakeErrorGroup</a> followed
by <a href="#ErrorGroupGaussErrors">ErrorGroupGaussErrors</a>.&nbsp;
All arguments are defined identically as in those two functions.<br>
<br>
Given that we have SetGaussianErrors, why would anybody use
MakeErrorGroup and ErrorGroupGaussErrors?&nbsp; The main reason is
execution speed:&nbsp; the process of finding all the elements which
are to receive errors takes a long time compared to simply applying the
errors.&nbsp; Any simulation which is going to repeatedly apply errors
to to the same cluster of elements is well-advised to generate an error
group once and use ErrorGroupGaussErrors repeatedly rather than using
SetGaussianErrors repeatedly.<br>
