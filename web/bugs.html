<small>Known Bugs<br>
<br>
</small></span></div>
The Lucretia management endeavors to correct bugs as quickly as they
are discovered, especially any bugs in the mexfiles which can cause all
kinds of misery.&nbsp; In some cases we discover bugs which cause
mexfile problems but require sufficiently weird conditions to trigger
them that we put them on the back burner until we have a spare
moment.&nbsp; Those bugs are listed here.<br>
<br>
At this time there are no known, uncorrected bugs in Lucretia.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big><big>Corrected Known Bugs</big></big><br>
</div>
<br>
The following bugs were corrected in the release on 02-August-2007:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ill-Defined Short-Range Wakefields:</span>&nbsp;
in the case where wakefields are defined with z values &lt; 0 (the
opposite of what Lucretia is expecting), a crash can occur.&nbsp; We
think that the problem is that the spliner tries to use the shape of
the wakefield (defined only for z&lt;0) to apply wakes from leading
slices of the bunch to trailing slices (for which z&gt;0), and this can
lead to a huge numerical value for the wakefield, especially in the
case of the longitudinal wake.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Humongous Energy Spread:</span>&nbsp;
In the case of a bunch with an RMS energy spread which is comparable to
1, a crash occurs.&nbsp; We think that the problem is that rays with a
negative initial energy are generated in the MakeBeam routines, and
that the logic which traps ill-constructed beams at entry to TrackThru
is not catching them properly.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Crash on Apertures:</span>&nbsp; a bug
is present which causes Lucretia to crash when it tries to determine
whether a ray is outside the aperture of an element.&nbsp; Setting the
Aper flag in the TrackFlag data structure to zero allows tracking to
continue without crashing (but also without checking positions of rays
wrt the apertures).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Synchrotron Radiation:</span>&nbsp; A
minor error in the handling of synchrotron radiation in bend magnets
causes the emittance growth from SR to be slightly overestimated.<br>
