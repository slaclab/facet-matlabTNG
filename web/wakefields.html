<div style="text-align: left;">The storage of wakefield data in the WF
global structure is described in the <a href="data_elements.html#WF">wakefield</a>
section of the <a href="data_elements.html">data elements</a>
page.&nbsp; Here we describe the algorithms which are used to simulate
the effects of the wakefields on the beam.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Short-Range Longitudinal
Wakefields (WF.ZSR)</big><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
</div>

</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">The short-range longitudinal wakefield
is stored in WF in the time-domain:&nbsp; the decelerating voltage
generated behind a driving particle, in V/C/m.&nbsp; Thus the stored
wake must be convolved with the longitudinal distribution of each bunch
in the beam, which is accomplished as follows:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>When a bunch reaches an element with a longitudinal short-range
wake, and that element's SRWF_Z <a
 href="element_classes.html#TrackFlag">tracking flag</a> is set to
enable the longitudinal wake, the longitudinal coordinates of the rays
are examined to find the ray which is at the median position and to
find the z range about the median which contains 68% of the ray's total
charge.&nbsp; Half of this width is used as the "effective RMS" of the
bunch.</li>
  <li>The rays are then binned.&nbsp; The bin width used is the
effective RMS calculated in the previous step multiplied by the
BinWidth value for the given WF.ZSR entry (ie, if WF.ZSR(j).BinWidth ==
0.1, then bins with a width of 0.1 * the effective RMS are used).&nbsp;
The total charge and the actual electrical center of each bin is then
determined (since it is not guaranteed that the rays in a given bin are
uniformly distributed in z).&nbsp; Bins which contain no actual charge
are deleted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The wakefield data in WF.ZSR is used to determine the
deceleration (in V/m) at each bin n due to the wakefield driven by each
bin m which is upstream of bin n:&nbsp; V(n,m) = Q(m) *
K[z(n)-z(m)].&nbsp; The wakefield K is determined by cubic spline
interpolation of the data in WF.ZSR.&nbsp; Per the fundamental theorem
of beam loading, V(n,n) = Q(n)*K[0]/2.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The total deceleration at each bin n, V(n) [dimensions of V/m] is
the sum over m of V(n,m).&nbsp; This sum is calculated and stored.</li>
  <li>When tracking the rays of the bunch through the element with a
longitudinal short-range wake, the energy gain of each ray is
calculated with the decelerating voltage taken into account:&nbsp;
Delta E = V_element * cos(phi + kz) - L_element * V(n), where n is the
bin that contains the given ray.</li>
  <li>In a typical accelerator, a given wakefield is used by more than
one element.&nbsp; After a given wakefield is convolved with the charge
distribution of a given bunch, that convolved wakefield is kept around
so that it can be used if and when the bunch encounters another element
which points to the same wakefield.</li>
  <li>All convolved wakefields associated with a bunch are deleted if
one of the following things
happen:
    <ul>
      <li> The bunch encounters a sector bend magnet (since the
momentum compaction of a sector bend changes the longitudinal charge
distribution
in non-trivial ways)</li>
      <li>One or more rays in the bunch is stopped (encounters an
aperture, decelerated to zero momentum, deflected &gt; 90 degrees)</li>
      <li>The tracking operation is completed and execution is passed
back to Matlab.</li>
    </ul>
If the bunch later encounters a new element which points at a
wakefield, the wakefield is convolved with the new longitudinal charge
distribution of the bunch.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Note that it is not strictly accurate to use
the same convolved wake for all structures that point at a given wake
in WF.ZSR, since there are high-order phase slip terms in the transfer
map for a quadrupole or even a drift space.&nbsp; Since these terms are
typically small, Lucretia assumes that it does not need to re-convolve
the wakefields unless the bunch passes through a bend magnet.&nbsp; If
you suspect that in your particular application the high-order phase
slip in drifts and/or quads is significant, you can take advantage of
the fact that the convolved short-range wakes are deleted at the end of
a tracking operation:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; for elemno = elem1:elem2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,Beam] =
TrackThru(elemno,elemno,Beam,1,length(Beam.Bunch),0) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
<br>
will do the same thing as<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,Beam] =
TrackThru(elem1,elem2,Beam,1,length(Beam.Bunch),0) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
except that it will reconvolve the SRWFs on each element which uses
them.<br>
<br>
Note that each bunch in a beam is separately convolved with the
short-range longitudinal wakefield of a given element, so that
reasonable accuracy can be achieved even if the bunches in the beam
have substantially different longitudinal distributions.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Short-Range Transverse Wakefields
(WF.TSR)</big><br>
</div>
<br>
The short-range transverse wakes are quite similar to the short-range
longitudinal wakes, except that the time-domain wake function has
dimensions of V/C/m^2.&nbsp; The same technique is used for wakefield
convolution except that it is necessary to keep the matrix V(n,m) which
here has dimensions of V/m^2.&nbsp; During tracking the bunch is first
tracked to the center of the element with a wakefield, and at the
center the horizontal and vertical positions of each bin are
computed.&nbsp; The deflections for each bin are computed using this
information, and applied to each element in the bin.&nbsp; The bunch is
then tracked through the second half of the element.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Long-Range Transverse Wakefields
(WF.TLR)</big><br>
</div>
<br>
At this time only a frequency-domain representation of the multibunch
transverse wakefield is supported.&nbsp; A frequency domain
representation is most appropriate for elements which have a small
number of modes which are far apart compared to their Q factors (this
is, for example, the typical situation in a superconducting RF
structure).&nbsp; A frequency domain wakefield consists of one or more
modes; each mode has 2 polarizations (nominally x and y), and each
polarization of each mode has a frequency and a Q factor.&nbsp; In
principle each polarization also has a kick factor (in V/C/m^2), but in
practice the kick factors for the 2 modes are quite close to one
another so Lucretia models a mode as having 2 frequencies, 2 Q factors,
and 1 kick factor.&nbsp; Each
wakefield also has a BinWidth.<br>
<br>
The way long-range wakefields work in Lucretia is as follows:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>All the rays in each bunch are binned according to the bunch
length and the BinWidth parameter, just as they are for short-range
wakes.&nbsp; This allows some simulation of the effect of the
variation&nbsp; in the wakefield over the length of the bunch (if this
variation is judged to be uninteresting, set BinWidth == 0).&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>As a bunch passes through the center of a structure, any kicks
excited by previous bunches are propagated forward in time to the bunch
arrival time using the structure's mode frequencies and Q values, and
the bunch spacing in the beam which is being tracked.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>The kicks are applied to the bins of the bunch.</li>
  <li>The additional excitation from the bunch's passage through the
structure is added to the existing excitation (taking into account the
different phases of the existing and new excitation).&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Transverse long-range wakefields can be turned on or off in any
LCAV by setting its LRWF_T flag to 1 or 0, respectively.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The Tilt parameter allows the user to specify that
the axes of the 2 polarizations are different from the element's
nominal x and y axes.&nbsp; The combination of unequal frequencies for
the 2 polarizations and
mode rotation angle can allow jitter in one plane to excite modes that
will ultimately deflect the beam in the other plane.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multibunch Tracking Modes:</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Lucretia allows 2 modes of multibunch tracking:&nbsp; element-wise
tracking and bunch-wise tracking.&nbsp; In element-wise tracking, all
bunches are tracked through a particular element before any bunches are
tracked through the next element.&nbsp; This is the most efficient way
to track multibunch beams, and is selected by either leaving out the
6th argument in function <a href="tracking.html#TrackThru">TrackThru</a>
or
else selecting a value of 0 for the sixth argument.<br>
<br>
Bunchwise tracking is the opposite:&nbsp; each bunch will be tracked
through all the selected elements before the next bunch is tracked
through any elements.&nbsp; Bunchwise tracking permits the user to
track a multi-bunch beam with long-range wakefields and perform
operations in Matlab between bunches, to simulate tuning or feedback on
an intra-train time scale.<br>
<br>
This leads to an interesting question:&nbsp; how does Lucretia figure
out whether a given tracking operation is a continuation&nbsp; of a
previous operation (in which case it needs to remember the long-range
wake kicks from earlier operations), as opposed to a new operation --
tracking of a whole&nbsp; new bunch train after all the wakes have died
out (in which case it needs to forget the long range wake kicks from
previous operations)?&nbsp; The answer is the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Any and all differentiation between continuations of existing
trains and new trains is performed on an element-by-element basis, so
any tracking that is done through one set of elements will not cause
other elements to delete their wakefield kick data.</li>
  <li>Any elementwise tracking is automatically treated as a new and
complete bunch train:&nbsp; when you track a train elementwise through
an LCAV, the LCAV kicks are deleted at the start and at the end of
elementwise tracking.</li>
  <li>Any bunchwise tracking is treated as a new and complete bunch
train when the bunch number of the first bunch to be tracked in the
current operation is lower than that of the last bunch tracked on the
previous operation (ie, if the previous operation tracked bunches
1--100, then if you track bunch 101 or 102 or etc it will be treated as
a continuation with the existing wake kicks, if you track bunch 1 or 2
or etc it will be treated as a new bunch train and old wake kicks are
deleted).</li>
  <li>If TrackThru is instructed to clear its memory (ie,
TrackThru("clear")), all existing wake kicks on all elements will be
deleted.</li>
  <li>If the maximum number of modes needed to represent the wakefields
in WF.TLR or WF.TLRErr is increased, all existing wake kicks on all
elements will be deleted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Long-Range Transverse Error
Wakefields
(WF.TLRErr)</big><br>
</div>
<br>
A long-range error wakefield is a deflecting field which is present
even when the beam passes on-axis through the RF structure.&nbsp;
Typically this is due to some internal deformation of the structure
(for example if the structure is bowed so that when the beam passes
through the "center" as indicated by its fiducials it does not pass
through the mean electrical center of the element).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Lucretia's management and formalism for long-range transverse error
wakes is identical to its handling of standard long-range transverse
wakes, with one exception:&nbsp; each mode in an error wake has 2 kick
factors, one for the horizontal polarization and one for the vertical
polarization.&nbsp; Also, as the description above indicates, the error
wake kicks a beam even if it goes down the center of the structure, and
thus the error wakes are in V/C/m and not V/C/m^2.<br>
