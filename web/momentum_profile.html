<small>Momentum Profile Management<br>
<br>
</small></span></div>
"Momentum profile management" is the act of correctly computing the
expected momentum as a function of S position, and scaling magnet
strengths to correctly match the momentum profile.&nbsp; Typically
there are two types of momentum profile adjustments that one might want
to make:&nbsp; setting the initial design momentum profile, and
updating the momentum profile during operation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Setting the Design Momentum Profile</span>:&nbsp;
this is typically something which is done once, when the lattice is
instantiated.&nbsp; At instantiation time one wants the BEAMLINE{}.P
values to exactly match expectations and one wants all element settings
to be correctly matched to it.&nbsp; At this point we are still
"setting up the perfect lattice" and not yet concerning ourselves with
the finite granularity of power supplies, limited accuracy of our tools
for energy measurement, etc.&nbsp; The correct tool for this job is
SetDesignMomentumProfile.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Updating the Momentum Profile</span>:&nbsp;
after one has started simulating operation of the accelerator, it
becomes useful to accurately simulate realistic momentum profile
management.&nbsp; Here one needs to take into account realistic limits
on knowledge of accelerator parameters, finite granularity on the
devices used for tuning, changes in active klystron complement, and the
fact that some elements cannot be scaled when the momentum profile is
varied (for example, permanent magnets).&nbsp; The correct tool for
this job is UpdateMomentumProfile.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SetDesignMomentumProfile"></a>SetDesignMomentumProfile:</span><br>
<br>
Recalculate the momentum-vs-S profile of the accelerator and scale
magnets to the new profile, neglecting realistic accelerator
limitations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; stat =
SetDesignMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0 )<br>
<br>
computes the momentum and energy gain from start to end inclusive,
given an initial momentum P0 and single bunch charge Q.&nbsp; Sets the
new momentum profile into the BEAMLINE, scaling all magnets and TCAVs
from
the&nbsp; current profile to the new one.&nbsp; Performs
renormalization of all <a
 href="lattice_generation.html#RenormalizeKlystron">klystrons</a> and <a
 href="lattice_generation.html#RenormalizePS">power supplies</a>
encountered in the desired range, and also <a
 href="#UpdateKlystronStatus">updates the status of all klystrons</a>.&nbsp;
The mean synchrotron radiation losses are included for any bends,
correctors, TCAVs, or multipoles with a dipole field which have a
SynRad tracking flag which is nonzero.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; stat =
SetDesignMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0, Pf )<br>
<br>
performs the same operation, but also scales the voltages on all LCAVs
to force the momentum on the downstream face of the last element in the
desired range to be Pf.<br>
<br>
Status returns:&nbsp; stat{1} == +1 in the event of success.&nbsp;
Other possible return values are -1 (power supply which supplies
magnets inside and outside the range was detected), -2 (klystron which
supports RF units inside and outside the range was detected), -3
(updated momentum profile would set P&lt;0 at some point in the range),
-4 (invalid range, Q, or P0 arguments), -5 (unable to scale due to
infinite or negative scale factor).&nbsp; If stat{1} != +1, no momenta
or Egain values will be updated and no magnets will be scaled.<br>
<br>
Note on synchrotron radiation:&nbsp; At the moment,
SetDesignMomentumProfile is not clever enough to scale synchrotron
radiation losses when it scales to a final momentum.&nbsp; The problem
is that the energy loss in SR in a magnet depends on the momentum of
the particles in that magnet (which is changed when the lattice is
rescaled), but the scale factor depends on the amount of SR losses
(which change as the magnets are scaled).&nbsp; Fortunately, in these
circumstances SetDesignMomentumProfile can converge on the right answer
if it is iterated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="UpdateMomentumProfile"></a>UpdateMomentumProfile:</span><br>
<br>
Recalculate the momentum-vs-S profile of the accelerator and scale
magnets to the new profile, taking into account realistic accelerator
limitations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; stat&nbsp; =
UpdateMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0 )<br>
<br>
estimates the current momentum and energy gain at each point from start
to end inclusive, given an initial momentum P0 at BEAMLINE{start} and a
bunch charge Q.&nbsp; In the process the status of all klystrons which
support elements in the start:end range <a href="#UpdateKlystronStatus">will
be updated</a>.&nbsp; In this way the current actual complement of
active klystrons becomes
the current design complement for purposes of momentum profile
calculations.&nbsp; The computed P and Egain values are loaded into the
correct BEAMLINE fields.&nbsp; The mean synchrotron radiation losses
are included for any bends,
correctors, TCAVs, or multipoles with a dipole field which have a
SynRad tracking flag which is nonzero.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; stat =
UpdateMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0, scale )<br>
<br>
performs the same updating of the momentum profile, and also optionally
scales power supplies within the start:end range based on the change in
design momentum at those locations.&nbsp; If scale == 0 or is absent,
no scaling is performed, if scale == 1 power supplies are scaled,
subject to limits on granularity.&nbsp; Magnets which are not on a
power supply (ie, permanent magnets) are not scaled; TCAVs are also not
scaled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; stat =
UpdateMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0, scale, Pf )<br>
<br>
performs the same operation, but also scales the LCAV Egain
values to achieve a momentum of Pf on the downstream face of the last
element.&nbsp; Note that the klystron amplitudes and structure voltages
are not scaled; essentially, a "fudge" is uniformly applied to all
Egain values.&nbsp; The idea here is to allow calculation of an
approximate momentum profile in the case where there are unknown errors
but the final momentum is believed to be Pf.<br>
<br>
Possible stat{1} values from UpdateMomentumProfile and their
definitions are the same as those for SetDesignMomentumProfile.<br>
<br>
Note on synchrotron radiation:&nbsp; similar to
SetDesignMomentumProfile, and for similar reasons,
UpdateMomentumProfile does not give the exact right answer when SR and
acceleration are both present and scaling of the final momentum is
requested.&nbsp; UpdateMomentumProfile will also allow you to converge
on the right answer by iteration, but it has subtly different
requirements.&nbsp; If your desired final momentum is PF and
UpdateMomentumProfile arrives at an initial answer of PF - dP1, then
you can call UpdateMomentumProfile with a final momentum of PF + dP1;
this will get you to an answer of PF - dP2 (where dP2 &lt; dP1), and on
the next iteration you need to ask for a final momentum of PF + dP1 +
dP2; and so on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summarizing the differences between
SetDesignMomentumProfile and UpdateMomentumProfile:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>UpdateMomentumProfile scales a momentum profile to achieve a
desired final momentum by scaling the Egain parameters only, while
leaving the element voltages and klystron amplitudes at their original
values, in essence it "fudges" the profile to match the
desired/expected one; SetDesignMomentumProfile actually scales the
element voltages to achieve the desired final momentum.</li>
  <li>UpdateMomentumProfile scales magnet power supplies, so any magnet
without a power supply will not be scaled and scaling will only be
correct up to the granularity of the magnet power supplies;
SetDesignMomentumProfile scales the B values of the magnet directly,
regardless of power supply issues.&nbsp; Amongst other things, this
makes SetDesignMomentumProfile the correct tool to use when doing
initial setup of a beamline that does not yet have klystrons or power
supplies assigned (since UpdateMomentumProfile cannot scale any magnet
which has no power supply).<br>
  </li>
  <li>SetDesignMomentumProfile renormalizes klystron and power supply
parameters; UpdateMomentumProfile does not.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Here are a couple of other tools that are potentially of interest:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ComputeMomentumProfile"></a>ComputeMomentumProfile:</span><br>
<br>
Compute the momentum and energy gain at each point in a given region.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat, V_on, V_off,
V_load, V_SR] = ComputeMomentumProfile( start, end, Q )<br>
<br>
computes the momentum profile parameters over the range from start to
end inclusive for bunch charge Q.&nbsp; <br>
Return variable V_on is a matrix of the cosine-like, sine-like, and
total voltage of all RF units presently accelerating the beam (ie, all
units whose klystrons are in Status == ON or Status == MAKEUP).&nbsp;
V_off is a matrix of cosine-like, sine-like, and total voltage of all
hot-spare RF units (ie, all units whose klystrons are in Status ==
STANDBY).&nbsp; RF units powered by a failed klystron (Status ==
TRIPPED or Status == TRIPSTANDBY) are not counted in V_on or
V_off.&nbsp; V_load is the beam loading at each structure for single
bunch charge Q.&nbsp; V_SR is the synchrotron radiation losses at each
element.&nbsp; V_on, V_off, V_load, V_SR are all in GeV.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat, V_on, V_off,
V_load, V_SR,&nbsp; P] = ComputeMomentumProfile( start, end, Q, P0 )<br>
<br>
also computes the momentum P at each element given initial momentum P0.<br>
<br>
Return variable stat{1} == +1 if the calculation was successful, -4 if
the start, end, Q, P0, or Pf arguments are not well-formed, -5 if the
scaling is not possible due to infinite or negative scaling factor
required, 0 if invalid synchrotron radiation parameters are
encountered, -6 if synchrotron radiation calculations fail due to
negative or zero design momentum in one or more elements.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="UpdateKlystronStatus"></a>UpdateKlystronStatus:</span><br>
<br>
Update the current status of a set of klystrons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; UpdateKlystronStatus(
klist )<br>
<br>
examines the status of each klystron in klist.&nbsp; Any klystron with
Status == TRIPPED is changed to TRIPSTANDBY; any klystron with Status
== MAKEUP is changed to ON.&nbsp; This allows the user to incorporate
changes in the active klystron complement into the current momentum
model.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="CalculateSR"></a>CalculateSR:</span><br>
<br>
Calculate synchrotron radiation parameters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,umean] = CalculateSR( P,
BL, L ) <br>
<br>
computes the mean energy loss experienced by a particle with initial
momentum P [GeV/c] which passes through an element of effective length
L [m] with integrated field BL [T.m].&nbsp; The returned loss is in
GeV.&nbsp; Return variable stat{1} == 1 indicates success, stat{1} == 0
indicates L &lt;= 0 bad argument, stat{1} == -2 indicates P &lt;= 0 bad
argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,umean,urms] = CalculateSR(
P, BL, L ) <br>
<br>
also returns the RMS energy loss (in GeV) for particles with the given
parameters.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,umean,urms,uc] =
CalculateSR( P, BL, L ) <br>
<br>
also returns the critical energy (in GeV) for particles with the given
parameters.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,umean,urms,uc,nphot] =
CalculateSR( P, BL, L ) <br>
<br>
also returns the mean number of emitted photons for particles with the
given parameters.<br>
