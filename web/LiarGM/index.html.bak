<H1><STRONG>GROUND MOTION MODEL IN LIAR</STRONG></H1>
<P><a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/nlc/local/AccelPhysics/codes/liar/web/liar.htm" target="_blank">LIAR</a>
and <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/nlc/local/AccelPhysics/codes/liar/web/liar_matlab.htm" target="_blank">Matlab-liar</a>
allow to model ground motion as described by P(<font face="Symbol">w</font>,k) spectrum. Here
<font face="Symbol"> w</font> is temporal
frequency and k is spatial wave-number. Ground motion model is defined by a
parameter file. Three examples are given here (<a href="gm_model_A.data">model A</a>,
<a href="gm_model_B.data">model B</a>, <a href="gm_model_C.data">model C</a>).
More description about the model and parameters will be provided soon. Still,
quite detailed description exists, though it is spread through several articles.
See for example the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~seryi/gm/gm_papers/p5323_1.html" target="_blank">PRE</a>,
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~seryi/gm/gm_papers/slac-pub-8487.html" target="_blank">EPAC2000</a>
and <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~seryi/gm/gm_papers/moa13.html" target="_blank">Linac2000</a>
papers. For the source of the GM routines in LIAR go <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/cvsweb/liar/src/?root=/afs/slac/g/nlc/codes">here</a>
and look for the files named <i>gm_*.f .</i></P>
<P>The model allows simulations of various things. Several different examples
are placed on this web page to illustrate varius features.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <b><u> first example</u></b>, two FODO linacs (for <b> e+</b> and <b>e-</b>) pointing to each other. The IP
position is at s=0.&nbsp; The files used are Matlab-liar
files (<a href="gm_two_fodo.m.txt">gm_two_fodo.m</a>, <a href="init_fodo100.m.txt">init_fodo100.m</a>,
<a href="fodo_fig.m.txt">fodo_fig.m</a>), MAD file (<a href="fodo100.mad.txt">fodo100.mad</a>),
and the <a href="gm_model_B.data">model B</a> input file. The beta functions for
this beamline are <a href="fodo100.gif" target="_blank">shown here</a>. The <b> results</b> are shown on
the picture placed on top of this page <b> (<a href="fodo_anime_3.gif" target="_blank">click
to
see animation of how it was actually moving</a>)</b>. Also check <a href="zoom_t01.gif"><b>this
picture</b></a> to see that ground moves continuously around IP, while e+ and
e- beams are (obviously) separated at the IP. &nbsp; See also the <a href="bb_vs_t.gif" target="_blank"><b>difference of
position</b></a> of e+ and e- beams at the IP versus time. This example took
250sec on 700MHz 128MB Pentium III laptop.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <b><u> second example</u></b>, again, two (short) FODO linacs are considered. In this case
the rms of the relative e+ e- beam offset at the IP versus time is compared with
analytical calculations.&nbsp; The MatLiar and parameter files used in this
example are <a href="gm_twofodo_ipbboff.m.txt">gm_twofodo_ipbboff.m</a>, <a href="init_fodo12.m.txt">init_fodo12.m</a>,
<a href="fodo_ipoff_fig.m.txt">fodo_ipoff_fig.m</a>, <a href="fodo12.mad.txt">fodo12.mad</a>,
<a href="gm_model_B2.data">gm_model_B2.data</a>.The <b> results</b> are shown in <a href="fodo12_liar_analytics.gif"><b>this
plot</b></a>. Symbols correspond to <i> simulations</i> by LIAR. Solid curve corresponds to
<i>
analytical results</i>, obtained by integrating the <i> spectral response function</i> (see <a href="fodo12_Goff.gif"><b>plot</b></a>
or <a href="y_kGoffGdis_fodo12.tap">data</a>) of the system with P(t,k) spectrum
obtained from the P(<font face="Symbol">w</font>,k) (see the table resulted from this integration <a href="fodo12_G_pwk_int.dat">here</a>).
The source of the program which allow such integration will be placed here
later. One can see that LIAR and analytic results correspond to each other
rather well, though the analytical results are ~30% higher. The reason for this
(small) disagreement will be chased down. The
spectral response function was calculated using FFADA program [by O.Napoly et
al.]. This example took 690sec on the same laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <b><u>third example</u></b>, exactly the same case was considered as
in the second one. The only difference is that tracking within LIAR was
performed by DIMAD. The input and parameter files are <a href="dimad_gm_twofodo_ipbboff.m.txt">dimad_gm_twofodo_ipbboff.m</a>,
<a href="fodo_ipoff_fig_dim.m.txt">fodo_ipoff_fig_dim.m</a>, <a href="fodo12dimad.mad.txt">fodo12dimad.mad</a>,
<a href="init_fodo12dimad.m.txt">init_fodo12dimad.m</a>. The <b>results</b> are <a href="fodo12_liardimad_analytics.gif"><b>here</b></a>.
This example took 1hour and 35min on the same laptop (in contrast to LIAR, DIMAD
actually tracks particles, therefore it takes more time).</P>
<P>In the <u><b>fourth example</b></u>, it is shown how to save from LIAR the
amplitudes of ground motion harmonics (see <a href="gm_pwk_save.m.txt">gm_pwk_save.m</a>)
into an ASCII file. Three saved files, corresponding to each of the models (see <a href="am_ams_A.out">am_ams_A.out</a>,
<a href="am_ams_B.out">am_ams_B.out</a>, <a href="am_ams_C.out">am_ams_C.out</a>),
can then be used to generate ground motion using a custom written code. The
files <a href="gm_read_saved.m.txt">gm_read_saved.m</a>, <a href="gm_gen_from_file.m.txt">gm_gen_from_file.m</a>,
<a href="gm_gen_fig.m.txt">gm_gen_fig.m</a> show an example of how to do this in
Matlab. See here the Matlab generated&nbsp; <a href="gm_gen_x.gif"><b>horizontal</b></a>
and <a href="gm_gen_y.gif"><b>vertical</b></a> ground motion. (Do not plan to
use, though, such Matlab driven generator of ground motion. It is too much slow.
The above given example took 54.5min, about 100 times longer than a Fortran or C
code would do).&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <u><b>fifth example</b></u>, the spectra P(t,k) found from ground
motion generated within LIAR are compared with the modeling theoretical spectra.
The files used to generate ground motion are <a href="gm_fodo_fft_1.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_1.m</a>,
<a href="gm_fodo_fft_2.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_2.m</a>, <a href="init_fodo.m.txt">init_fodo.m</a>,
<a href="fodo.mad.txt">fodo.mad</a>. The files that creates spectra are <a href="plot_fft.m.txt">plot_fft.m</a>
and <a href="gm_fodo_fft_fig.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_fig.m</a>. The Fortran program
which generates theoretical modeling P(t,k) (and also P(<font face="Symbol">w</font>,L))
by integration of&nbsp; P(<font face="Symbol">w</font>,k) is <a href="pwk2p.f.txt">pwk2p.f</a>.
Example of its input is <a href="pwk2p.inp.txt">here</a>. The <b>results</b> of
these example are shown in <b>the following plots</b>, for different time: <a href="ptk_001s.gif"><b>t
= 0.001 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk_01s.gif"><b>t = 0.01 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk_1s.gif"><b>t
= 0.1 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk1s.gif"><b>t = 1 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk10s.gif"><b>t
= 10 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk100s.gif"><b>t = 100 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk1000s.gif"><b>t
= 1000 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk10000s.gif"><b>t = 10000 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk1e5s.gif"><b>t
= 1e5 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk1e6s.gif"><b>t = 1e6 s</b></a>, <a href="ptk1e7s.gif"><b>t
= 1e7 s</b></a>. You can see that in spite of the huge range of time (ten orders
of magnitude), the difference of generated and modeled spectra is rather
small.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <b><u>sixth example</u></b>, the spectra P(<font face="Symbol">w</font>,L)
are calculated from ground
motion generated within LIAR and are compared with the modeling theoretical spectra.
The Mat-Liar files are <a href="gm_fodo_fft_w.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_w.m</a>, <a href="init_line.m.txt">init_line.m</a>,
<a href="line.mad.txt">line.mad</a>, and the spectra and pictures are generated
by <a href="gm_fodo_wfft2_fig.m.txt">gm_fodo_wfft2_fig.m</a>.This example took
59min on the same laptop. The <b>resulting spectra</b> are shown in <b>the
following plots</b>, for different spatial separation: <a href="pwl10m.gif"><b>dS
= 10 m</b></a>, <a href="pwl30m.gif"><b>dS = 30 m</b></a>, <a href="pwl100m.gif"><b>dS
= 100 m</b></a>. You can see that the model agrees quite will with the generated
motion.&nbsp;</P>
<P><i>Some features shown in the following example are not yet included into the
latest LIAR release.</i></P>
<P>In the <b><u>seventh example</u></b>, it is shown how to include a transfer
function (TF) between ground motion and a particular focusing element. Either
'standard' or arbitrary TF can be assigned to a particular girder. The X and Y
planes can have different TF. The 'standard' TF is defined by the resonance
frequency and quality factor. Arbitrary TF can be given by a file.&nbsp; There
is also a possibility to artificially displace position at which support is mounted on the ground.&nbsp;The Mat-Liar files showing use of 'standard' TF are <a href="gm_fodo_fft_w_tf.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_w_tf.m</a>
and <a href="gm_fodo_wfft_tf_fig.m.txt">gm_fodo_wfft_tf_fig.m</a>, and the
beamline is the same as in the sixth example. The <b>results</b> are shown in <b>the
following plots</b> (<a href="spectra_tf_stdt.gif"><b>spectra</b></a> and their <a href="tf_stdt.gif"><b>ratio
in comparison with 'standard' TF</b></a>).&nbsp;The Mat-Liar files showing use of arbitrary TF&nbsp; (given by file <a href="girder_tf.dat.txt">girder_tf.dat</a>)&nbsp;
are&nbsp; <a href="gm_fodo_fft_w_tf2.m.txt">gm_fodo_fft_w_tf2.m</a> and <a href="gm_fodo_wfft_tf_fig2.m.txt">gm_fodo_wfft_tf_fig2.m</a>.
The <b>resulting plots</b> are here (<a href="spectra_tf_arbtr.gif"><b>spectra</b></a>
and their <a href="tf_arbtr.gif"><b>ratio in comparison with TF</b></a>).&nbsp;<br>
</P>
<P>In the <b><u>eighth example,</u></b> it is shown how to include additional
technical noises. These noises are uncorrelated with ground motion and can be
assigned to a particular girder. Arbitrary number of noises can be used, the
vertical and horizontal planes can have different or no noises. Noises are
defined by its power spectrum p(<font face="Symbol">w</font>). Transfer
functions can be used in addition to noises (TF only affect ground motion, not
the noises). The Mat-Liar files showing use of noises and TF are <a href="gm_tf_noise.m.txt">gm_tf_noise.m</a>
and <a href="gm_tf_noise_fig.m.txt">gm_tf_noise_fig.m</a>. In this case the same
beamline was used as in the example 6, and the <b>results</b> for power spectrum
of relative motion (dL=30m in all cases) are shown <b>in the following plots</b>.
See <a href="gm_noise_tf1.gif"><b>plot where only ground motion and noises are
present</b></a>, and the <a href="gm_noise_tf2.gif"><b>case when transfer
function was used in addition to noises</b></a>. On the last plot, note that
relative motion of two quadrupoles, when one of them is on perfect girder and
another one is on imperfect girder (given by a&nbsp; transfer function),
considerably increase even at quite low frequency (down to 1/50 of the girder
resonance) .&nbsp;
