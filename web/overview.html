<div style="text-align: left;">Lucretia is &quot;A Matlab based
toolkit for the modelling and simulation of single-pass electron
transport lines."<br>
<br>
Now, just what does that mean?<br>
<br>
"Single-pass electron transport lines" includes linacs, bunch
compressors, linac-driven FELs, the Low Emittance Transport (LET) of a
linear collider, and similar systems.&nbsp; The main point here is that
the physics modelling in Lucretia is oriented towards the issues that
are important for single-pass systems (such as short range and long
range wakefields) and not so much towards the issues important for
rings (like ensuring that the tracker is symplectic to the precision
limits of the CPU).&nbsp; There is an implicit assumption used in the
code that the particles have the rest mass of an electron, so
simulating proton or ion (or muon!) transport is probably out of the
question.<br>
<br>
"A Matlab-based toolkit" means that most of the work and complexity is
contained in Matlab scripts and functions -- there's not a "program" in
the sense that, for example, <a href="http://mad.home.cern.ch/mad/">MAD</a>
or <a
 href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/accel/nlc/local/AccelPhysics/codes/liar/web/liar.htm">LIAR</a>
is a program.&nbsp; This presents certain advantages and certain
disadvantages:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The key advantage is obvious:&nbsp;
with a fully-contained program like MAD, one is basically constrained
to perform operations which the developers have thought to incorporate
into the program.&nbsp; For some operations (like Twiss parameter
calculation), the operation can be done in a universally-applicable way
so programs like MAD are great.&nbsp; For other operations (like
modelling the effect of klystron power or phase variation) it's much
harder, since the effect is tied so strongly to the idiosyncracies of
the particular implementation (how many RF structures per
klystron?&nbsp; Are the structures for a given klystron clustered or
distributed?&nbsp; Are all the RF units identical or is there some
variation in their design?).&nbsp; The added flexibility of the
Lucretia approach makes it much easier to do studies that would be
difficult or impossible in a more "enclosed" code like MAD.&nbsp;
Furthermore, to the extent possible all of the working parts of
Lucretia are written as Matlab scripts and functions (so-called
"m-files"), which are interpreted at execution time, rather than as
functions in a compiled language such as C.&nbsp; In principle there's
not much difference between a Matlab toolkit for accelerators, like
Lucretia or <a href="http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/at/">AT</a>,
and a toolkit based on a library written in a compiled language, like <a
 href="http://www.desy.de/%7Emerlin/">Merlin</a> or <a
 href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/%7Edcs/bmad/">BMAD</a>.&nbsp; In
practice, I'm certainly more productive when I'm writing and modifying
Matlab scripts than when I'm writing and modifying compiled code.&nbsp;
Why that is I don't really know, but it was that observation that drove
me to develop Lucretia in the way that I did.<br>
<br>
The key disadvantage, of course, is that the user is obligated to do
more work at the start to assemble the accelerator model, etc.&nbsp; As
opposed to MAD, where you just load the deck and start executing MAD
commands, here the initial stage can be more cumbersome (this is
sometimes referred to as the Ikea Model -- "Make the customer do all
the work").&nbsp; To surmount this difficulty we have provided some
<a href="function_index.html">scripts</a> which should (hopefully!)
make
life easier (if nothing else,
they give the user a starting point, a set of tools which can be
tweaked to accomodate the unusual features of the beamline in question).<br>
</div>
<br>
Additional features of Lucretia which distinguish it from a crowded
field
of alternatives are the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Interactivity.&nbsp; The user can directly examine and manipulate
the data structures representing the beam, beamline, RF sources, etc.,
in the Matlab environment.&nbsp; The barriers to such direct
examination and manipulation are lower than in many other simulation
codes.</li>
  <li>Fixed relationships between elements.&nbsp; Lucretia's KLYSTRON, <a
 href="data_elements.html#GIRDER">GIRDER</a>, and PS elements
permit the user to represent fixed position or
excitation relationships between elements (ie, the fact that several RF
structures are supported by one klystron, so you can't change the
phases of those structures wrt each other).&nbsp; For each of these
devices finite step size adjustability is supported (ie, klystron
phases which can only be adjusted in increments of 0.1 degrees,
etc).&nbsp; Most importantly, the relationships between the elements
are not "rule-driven", allowing a realistic diversity of relationships
(ie, the user is not constrained to, say, combining RF structures in
sets of 4, or combining consecutive RF structures, on a
klystron).&nbsp; The downside of the "not-rule-driven" nature is that
the user has to write a script to set up the KLYSTRON, GIRDER, and PS
relationships.</li>
  <li>Flexibility.&nbsp; The user can add any desired data fields to
the Lucretia data structures -- any fields not needed by a given
function will be ignored.&nbsp; If it's absolutely essential, there is
no penalty to adding fields pertaining to a magnet's winding paint
color (as opposed to the paint color used on the iron yoke, which is
typically different...).</li>
  <li>Built-in support for bunch trains and for colliding beams (ie,
tracking beams from 2 distant injectors to a common IP).</li>
  <li>Improved management of the "binning" of particles for short-range
wakefield calculations.</li>
  <li>Tracking can be performed by element, in which all bunches are
tracked through an element before any bunches are tracked through the
next element; or it can be performed by bunch, in which the first bunch
is tracked through all requested elements before the second bunch is
tracked through any of them.&nbsp; The former option is the default, as
it is the most efficient in terms of memory usage, but the option to
perform the latter allows simulations in which some tuning or feedback
processing occurs between bunches.</li>
  <li>Although Lucretia is not fully relativistically correct, effects
up to the lowest order in m<sub>e</sub>c/p can be included.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Last but not least, the advantages of the Matlab/Octave
environment are heavily exploited.&nbsp; Graphing, scripting,
sophisticated numerical operations, etc., are handled by the
environment (ie, somebody else writes and maintains your script parser,
graphics engine, etc), leaving physicists free to concentrate on
physics.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font size="+1">A Few Technical Details<br>
<br>
</font>
<div style="text-align: left;">As described above, our goal is to
maximize use of Matlab capabilities -- otherwise, why use Matlab at
all?&nbsp; Included in this is Matlab's support for programming (in the
form of scripts and functions).&nbsp; Wherever possible, we have used
the scripting and function capabilities for Lucretia's programming
needs.<br>
<br>
	The main place where this breaks down is in tracking.&nbsp; Tracking rays through 
	a beamline is the most compute-intensive operation in most accelerator 
	codes, and some simple tests quickly made it clear that the tracking 
	operation would need to be relegated to a compiled kernel.&nbsp; Fortunately, 
	Matlab has a
straightforward method to build a compiled program unit and give it the
"look and feel" of a conventional Matlab function interface (a
"mexfile" ).&nbsp; The tracking
function <a href="tracking.html#TrackThru">TrackThru</a> is implemented as a 
	&quot;mexfile&quot;.<br>
<br>
In principle, it might have been acceptable from the point of view of
execution speed to implement R-matrix operations (including Twiss
function propagation) as interpreted functions.&nbsp; In this case,
however, the transfer maps of each element had already been implemented
in the compiled kernel used for tracking.&nbsp; Thus, to make code
maintenance less brutal, we elected to implement R-matrix and Twiss
propagation in "mexfile" form.&nbsp; For similar reasons, <a
 href="lattice_verification.html">lattice verification</a> (ensuring
that the
lattice is free of errors and internally consistent) was implemented as
a mexfile, <a href="lattice_verification.html#VerifyLattice">VerifyLattice</a>.<br>
<br>
	At this time, operations other than tracking, R-matrix propagation, Twiss 
	propagation, and lattice verification are implemented as standard Matlab interpreted
functions.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font size="+1">Lucretia is Case
Sensitive!<br>
<br>
</font>
<div style="text-align: left;">The vast majority of the &quot;working parts&quot; of 
	Lucretia are Matlab scripts and functions, and Matlab is by
default case sensitive.&nbsp; The DLLs for tracking, matrix operations,
and verification are written in C, and are also case-sensitive.&nbsp;
In general, the user should assume that anything documented here is
case-sensitive, and that typing "Beamline" or "beamline" instead of
"BEAMLINE" is going to cause problems.<br>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font size="+1">What does the name
"Lucretia" mean?<br>
<br>
</font>
<div style="text-align: left;">If you're like me you've probably tired
of accelerator simulations with tortured-acronym names (ie, "MAD" =
"Methodical Accelerator Design," "LIAR" = "LInear Accelerator Research
code", etc).&nbsp; After thinking about acronyms for about 1.4
nanoseconds I decided to follow the example of Merlin, which is a name
and not an acronym.<br>
<br>
More specifically, the name "Lucretia" was partially an homage to LIAR
(thus the use of the "L" in the name and the logo), which I used
extensively for almost everything from 1998 to 2004.&nbsp; Many of the
concepts that became Lucretia were inspired by similar concepts in LIAR
and the Matlab version, mat-LIAR.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Even more specifically, "Lucretia" is named after a song by <a
 href="http://www.the-sisters-of-mercy.com/">The Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a
 href="http://www.the-sisters-of-mercy.com/lyrics/lucretia.htm">"Lucretia
My Reflection,"</a> from their Floodland album.&nbsp; You can see the <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBk8HzQp1Sg">video for this song</a>,
courtesy of <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>.&nbsp; Like
most rock videos, I don't think it really adds much to one's
understanding of the song, but features some potentially interesting
imagery.&nbsp; Alternately, YouTube has a <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0ii_ThWVI">live cover version
by Anhedonia</a> -- it's sort of like what the song would have been
like if originally recorded with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails on
vocals, and I think it does a better job conveying the intensity of the
song in a live venue.<br>
