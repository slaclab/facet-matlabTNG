If you have lots of spare Matlab licenses floating around (lucky you!), one 
option to run parallel Lucretia simulations is to simply run your serial 
simulation program in batch mode multiple times (using multiple execution 
commands on the same system or submitted to a batch farm). This is the simplest 
way of parallelising your simulation and requires the least modification to 
existing code. To do this, follow the steps below:<ul>
	<li>Decide on the granularity of the parallelisation and if the parallel 
	tasks need to communicate with each other. If inter-process communication or 
	fine-grained parallelisation is desired, this is probably not the best 
	approach (<a href="pLucretia.html">see the appropriate section on the 
	introductory page to this section</a>). If you can start the different 
	parallel instances of your simulation by simply specifying different 
	variable assignments (e.g. a flag specifying a machine configuration or a 
	random seed number) this method will work well.</li>
	<li>Create a shell script to run an instance of Matlab with given parameters 
	which are passed to the master Lucretia simulation script or function (see 
	below for examples). Note, under Windows you really need to have the master 
	simulation routine be a function- see the
	<a href="pLucretia_hints+tips.html">hints &amp; tips</a> section for 
	consequences of this.</li>
	<li>Execute the scripts with the different parameters (one Matlab session 
	should start per script instance), or submit various copies of the 
	executable scripts to your batch farm scheduler (e.g. using bsub with LSF, 
	or qsub with PBS). Note, one license gets used up per session if you have 
	concurrent licensing. It is good to have an additional script to automate 
	this task, <a href="jobSub.pl">here</a> is an example perl script I use to 
	submit 100 parallel jobs to a farm that uses the LSF scheduler (it also has 
	a flag to re-run failed jobs).</li>
</ul>
<p>How you collate the results from the task is up to you. You can look at the 
output of the sessions which can be piped into separate files, or you can have 
each session save its state on your file system and have a separate results 
collation routine. See the discussion page on hints and tips for parallel 
computing.</p>
<p>Example shell scripts for running individual simulation instances:</p>
<p><b>Under Windows:<br>
</b>In a .bat file, you need the following (assuming you aren't concerned about 
graphical output from each individual session) which utilises the windows <i>
<a href="http://www.robvanderwoude.com/index.html">start</a> </i>command:<br>
<b><i>start matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -minimize -r mfile(par1,par2,...) -logfile 
c:\temp\logfile</i></b><br>Where, you pass arguments to each session through the 
mfile.m function parameters, and the workspace text is saved in <i>logfile</i>. 
You should make sure to have the last command in mfile.m be <i>exit</i> 
otherwise you will have lots of open Matlab sessions to manually shut down (also 
consider enclosing all the code in the file in a try, catch block with <i>exit</i> 
as the last command in the catch section so that the session also exists 
properly in case of a run-time error).<br>
Note, there are other useful arguments you can use with the <i>start</i> 
command, such as assigning the execution priorities.</p>
<p><b>Under Linux:<br>
</b>The following works for c-shell type command shells, for bash-like ones use 
the ##(bash) commented lines instead of those above.<br>
So, for an example script, <b><i>lucretiaSubmit.csh</i></b>:<br>
<b><i>#!/bin/tcsh<br>
unsetenv DISPLAY<br>
##(bash) unset DISPLAY<br>
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash &gt;&amp;! outputDirectory/lucretiaJob_$1.out &lt;&lt; EOF<br>
##(bash) matlab -nodisplay -nosplash 1&gt; outputDirectory/lucretiaJob_$1.out 2&gt;&amp;1 
&lt;&lt; EOF<br>
randomSeed=$1<br>
machineConfig=$2<br>
myParam=$3<br>
lucretiaJob<br>
exit<br>
EOF<br>
</i></b>All the code specific to the simulation instance being run is put 
between the <i>matlab</i> command and <i>EOF</i> line. One instance of the above 
could be started with something like <i><b>&quot;./lucretiaSubmit.csh 1 configA 63&quot;
</b></i>for example. Note, make sure to assign the shell script executable 
privileges (<i><b>chmod a+x lucretiaSubmit.csh</b></i>) and make sure to have 
exit as the last command (see above comments on this in the &quot;Under Windows&quot; 
section).</p>
