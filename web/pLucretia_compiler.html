	<small>Generation of Standalone Lucretia Simulations Using the Matlab 
	Compiler<br>
</small></span></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/">Matlab Compiler</a> 
is a very useful tool that generates C or C++ code from Matlab functions. It 
also compiles this code to generate standalone executables which, when packaged 
with the provided Matlab run-libraries, are independent of the core Matlab 
package. This allows deployment of Lucretia simulations on any system, 
regardless of whether the Matlab environment (license manager) is installed. The 
Compiler also compiles code from almost any toolbox you may have installed and 
are using (notable exceptions are Simulink and DCT). This provides an easy route 
for creating &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; code by using the Compiler on existing 
serial code and running multiple instances on a single machine with multiple 
cores and/or processors or on a batch farm. By compiling simulation code in this 
way, multiple licenses are not needed as the generated code is free of the 
licensing restrictions and can therefore be run on any number of compute nodes 
simultaneously.</p>
<p>Note, for clarity I use &quot;Compiler&quot; with a capatalised 'C' when referring to 
the Matlab Compiler and use &quot;compiler&quot; to refer to the system c/c++ compiler.</p>
<p><b>Steps for deploying a parallel Lucretia simulation using the Matlab 
Compiler:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Write the simulation code, which must be started using a Matlab 
	function- the arguments to that function will be provided at the 
	command-line when the compiled code is produced and should be used to pass 
	arguments which separate one instance of the simulation from another (e.g. 
	random seed, machine configuration parameter etc.). See the
	<a href="pLucretia_hints+tips.html">hints &amp; tips</a> section for 
	consequences of having to use a function and not a script if this is a 
	change you need to make.</li>
	<li>Set up the compiler environment (see notes below on this).</li>
	<li>Compile the code using the mcc command (also, with R2006b and later 
	there is now a GUI environment for building- check out the Compiler 
	documentation if this kind of thing excites you). This invokes the 
	dependency checker which will examine the code you are trying to compile and 
	work out what other code needs to be pulled in to the compilation to make it 
	work. The upshot of this is, as long as everything you need is in the Matlab 
	search path (ie. you are compiling in an environment where the code you are 
	trying to build will successfully run) the compiler will generate an 
	executable file that behaves the same as when you execute the same function 
	from within a Matlab session. Most toolboxes are acceptable, mex files you 
	use also get pulled into the compilation automatically. If the simulation 
	requires .mat files to be dynamically loaded, these need to be included into 
	the compile command (which acts very much like a gcc compile command if you 
	are familiar with this). It is also possible to do more complicated things, 
	e.g. just generate the C code without compiling, generate static or dynamic 
	libs which can be further linked against custom c/c++ code etc.</li>
	<li>Decide how the generated executable file is to be deployed. If the 
	binary is to be run in an environment which can see a Matlab installation, 
	it is possible to run the code without further work by simply specifying 
	some environment variables (this varies according to which Matlab release 
	you are using- see the example below for the case of R2007a, read the Matlab 
	documentation for other releases). If the binary is to be run on an external 
	system which doesn't have Matlab installed anywhere (or you don't know what 
	version is likely to exist, or want to be independent of this) you need to 
	package up the MCR (Matlab Component Runtime)- a set of dynamic libraries 
	which provides the Matlab environment to run the compiled binary against- 
	see the
	<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/compiler/">
	Matlab Compiler</a> documentation for help in doing this. This will need to 
	be shipped wherever your compiled binary and supporting files are sent.</li>
	<li>Make a script that executes the compiled binary with desired parameters 
	for that instance of the simulation, the script should also contain 
	environment variables pointing to the installed Matlab libs when running 
	without the MCR. You should also make sure that these variables are exported 
	correctly if using a scheduler to submit parallel jobs on a batch farm.</li>
	<li>It is a good idea to also have a master script which runs multiple 
	instances of the job submission script generated above (<a href="jobSub.pl">here</a> 
	is an example perl script I use to submit 100 parallel jobs to a farm that 
	uses the LSF scheduler- it also has a flag to re-run failed jobs).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Setting up the Compiler environment</b></p>
<p>The first step after installing the Compiler into your Matlab software suite 
is to run the<i><b> mbuild -setup</b></i> command. This allows you to choose 
from the Matlab supported compilers that are installed on your system. For 
example, under unix this probably means the gcc compiler, and under windows the 
lcc compiler that ships with Matlab, one of the MS Visual Studio products or the 
Borland C compiler. With Linux, I have been successfully using the Intel 
compiler which gives considerable speed improvements over gcc with Intel 
chipsets (I have heard good results are also possible with AMD). Although the 
Intel compiler is not officially supported, I got this to work by simply 
replacing the <i><b>gcc,</b></i> <b><i>g++ </i></b>commands with the Intel 
equivalent <b><i>icc </i></b>and <b><i>icpc</i></b> in the makefile shells 
generated by the <b><i>mbuild -setup</i></b> command. I have listed some 
OS-dependent issues I have come across below:</p>
<p><i><b>Unix</b></i></p>
<p>The file <b><i>mbuildopts.sh</i></b> is generated by the process described 
above, the default location is in <i>~/.matlab/RXXXXX/mbuildopts.sh </i>(replace 
XXXXX with the version you are running)<i>.</i> I recommend leaving the default 
one alone generated for gcc and if you need to modify it, generate a copy in 
your working directory- the compiler uses a local copy in preference over the 
default one.<br>
Here is a snippet of the mbuildopts.sh file that deals with the gcc compiler 
(generated by Matlab R14):<br>
<i><b><font size="1">

<ul>
	<li>As I mentioned above, I found it possible to use the Intel compiler 
	(Version 9) by simply changing out the <i>gcc, g++ and $COMPILER </i>flags 
	to their Intel equivalent.</li>
	<li>I have always had problems with run-time errors if I use the file as 
	generated above (I get unresolved symbol errors). These have always been 
	caused by incompatibilities between the system c libs and the ones packaged 
	with Matlab. The solution for me has been to remove the link statement in 
	the CLAGS definition highlighted in red in the above code snippet (<i>-lstdc++)</i>, 
	if you get this type of error cropping up, you may want to try this first.</li>
	<li>Different releases of Matlab support different gcc releases, and you can 
	run into trouble if there is a large difference between the glibc version 
	you are running on your system and that supported by the particular release 
	of Matlab you have. For example, on the system I use, I have gcc 3.2 which 
	works fine with R14, but if I try to use any later release of Matlab which 
	has been built with gcc4+ I get all sorts of compilation issues, especially 
	with compiled mex code amongst the code being compiled.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example compilation command</b></p>
<p><b><i>&gt;&gt; mcc -mv masterSimFunction.m -a myData.mat<br>
</i></b>Compiles masterSimFunction and all dependencies, including the 
myData.mat data file which can be referenced in the simulation code to produce
<i>a ./masterSimFuncion </i>executable binary. You can pass arguments the same 
way as any command line executable file- e.g. <i><b>./masterSimFunction 1 'myParam' 
3.2</b></i> and the arguments are passed to the arguments in the Matlab <i>
masterSimFunction(A, B, C)</i> function.</p>
<p><b>Example run script</b></p>
<p>This code exists in <i>simRun.csh</i>:</p>
<p><i><b><font size="1">#!/bin/tcsh<br>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${MATLAB}/sys/os/glnx86:${MATLAB}/bin/glnx86:${MATLAB}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.5.0/lib/i386/native_threads<br>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${MATLAB}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.5.0/lib/i386/client:${MATLAB}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.5.0/lib/i386<br>
cd /afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/ey/whitegr/u01<br>
cd /afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/ey/whitegr/LET<br>
./simLET $1</font></b></i></p>
<p>It is submitted to a batch scheduler which runs the script automatically on a 
compute node of its choosing. For example, bsub ./simRun 12 is submitted; at run 
time the script is executed which sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables needed for 
the Matlab Compiled code to find the correct dynamic libs; then it cd's to an 
NFS directory I need to make sure it is mounted and finally cd's to the run 
directory before running the compiled Matlab simulation <i>simLET</i> with the 
argument '12' passed (which in this case sets the random number generator seed 
for this instance of the simulation).</p>
<p><b>General hints for running simulations with the Compiler</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>All arguments passed are passed to your master function at the command 
	line as strings. Therefore, if you are expecting numerical inputs to your 
	function, for the cases where you are running in the compiled environment 
	you need to convert using e.g. <b><i>str2double</i></b>.</li>
	<li>It is good to have the version of your simulation that runs under Matlab 
	and the version that runs in the compiled environment be the same. Where 
	code changes are necessary between the two, such as in the case above, a 
	useful built-in variable is <b><i>isdeployed</i></b> - this is set to be 
	true in the compiled environment and false under Matlab.</li>
	<li>Although recent versions of the Compiler are very good at seamlessly 
	converting all your Matlab code without additional work, there are some 
	exceptions you need to be aware of, check the documentation if you are 
	having compilation difficulties, some issues I have come across are listed 
	below.</li>
	<li>It is a good practice to avoid using shell commands whenever possible; 
	these make your code platform dependent, try to use the built-in Matlab 
	functions instead, e.g. <i><b>delete('file.txt')</b></i> instead of <b><i>!rm 
	file.txt </i></b>.</li>
	<li>At compile-time, the Matlab dependency checker iteratively goes through 
	your code and the code it calls etc. looking for the files required for the 
	compilation based on the Matlab search path. One thing that confuses this 
	process is if you refer to a function in a string- this will not get picked 
	up and will result in a run-time error as the function will not have been 
	compiled. One example of where this might happen is in an <b><i>eval</i></b> 
	command. There are 3 ways around this problem: Manually include the function 
	files in the compilation command using the <b><i>-a</i></b> switch; use 
	function handles instead; use the %#function pragma in the function where 
	the function string is used to tell the dependency checker that it is there. 
	See the Compiler documentation section on &quot;limitations and restrictions&quot; for 
	more details.</li>
