The Lucretia source code, makefiles, compiled libraries, and
executables (m-files and mexfiles) are all available from the <a
 href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page.&nbsp; Users should be able
to simply download Lucretia from there and then run it.&nbsp; We
currently provide the following builds of Lucretia:<br>

<br>
In principle it should be possible to build Lucretia for any platform
which has a reasonably current version of Matlab, but the platforms
above are the ones in common use at SLAC, so that's what I have access
to.&nbsp; Since SLAC is planning to eliminate its support for Solaris
in the near future, we will no longer be able to provide updated builds
for this platform at some point real soon.<br>
<br>
The Lucretia mexfiles for R14 are no longer updated; they are kept in
the directory Lucretia / src / mexsrc / mexfileOld.&nbsp; The R2006a
versions of the mexfiles are in directory: Lucretia / src / mexsrc /
mexfile2006.&nbsp; As soon as R2008a is finalized and made available at
SLAC, we will build versions of Lucretia against it and store the
resulting mexfiles in the mexfile2008 subdirectory of Lucretia / src /
mexsrc.&nbsp; We will keep both of these versions updated for awhile
because there
are compatibility problems between R2006/R2007 mexfiles and R2008
mexfiles -- they require different versions of glibc.&nbsp; Depending
on which version of Matlab you run, you should set the path
appropriately to pick up the compatible version of the mexfiles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;If you want to build the Lucretia mexfiles yourself, then there
are details for you
below.&nbsp; Be sure also to check out the page on <a
 href="mexfiles.html">code organization</a>.<br>

The approach I've taken to building Lucretia is to have a single
workspace (Lucretia) which contains LucretiaMain and LucretiaMatlab as
static library projects and GetRmats, GetTwiss, RmatAtoB, TrackThru,
VerifyLattice as dynamic library projects.&nbsp; I put all of the
source code and include files into a single directory.&nbsp; If you
arrange the files and workspace differently, the instructions below
will need some modification for you.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Build:&nbsp; Static Libraries</span><br>
<br>
LucretiaMain.lib needs the following files included in the project as
source files:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaPhysics.c<br>
and the following files included as header files:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaDictionary.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaPhysics.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVerifyMsg.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVersionProto.h<br>
With those included, it should simply build without further ado.<br>
<br>
LucretiaMatlab.lib need the following files included as source files:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlabErrMsg.c<br>
and the following files included as header files:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVersionProto.h<br>
Since LucretiaMatlab.lib also uses external headers mex.h and matrix.h,
MSVC needs to know which directory to use to look for these.&nbsp;
Typically this is the extern/include directory under the main Matlab
directory.&nbsp; To set this up, select Settings from the Project menu
(a window will appear).&nbsp; In the LHS of the window, select
LucretiaMatlab, in the "Settings For" pulldown menu select "All
Configurations".&nbsp; On the RHS, select the "C/C++" tab, select
"Preprocessor" from the Category pull-down menu, and in the box for
"Additional include directories" put in the directory which contains
the Matlab include files (for example on my PC it's
c:/matlab/MATLAB7/extern/include).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to build:&nbsp; Dynamic Libraries<br>
</span><br>
The 5 dynamic libraries take a bit more work to build properly.&nbsp;
Start by including the necessary source files and header files:<br>
<br>
GetRmats:&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetRmats.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetRmats.def<br>
GetRmats:&nbsp; Header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
GetTwiss:&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetTwiss.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetTwiss.def<br>
GetTwiss:&nbsp; Header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
RmatAtoB:&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RmatAtoB.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RmatAtoB.def<br>
RmatAtoB:&nbsp; Header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
TrackThru:&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TrackThru.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TrackThru.def<br>
TrackThru:&nbsp; Header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
VerifyLattice:&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VerifyLattice.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VerifyLattice.def<br>
VerifyLattice:&nbsp; Header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>
<br>
A word of explanation:&nbsp; the .def files are simple text files with
a small amount of information needed to make a proper DLL.&nbsp; For
example, the GetRmats.def contains the lines:<br>
LIBRARY GETRMATS.DLL<br>
EXPORTS mexFunction<br>
and the other .def files are the same except with a different library
name in line 1.<br>
<br>
Now, each of these DLLs needs to access both Matlab header files and
Matlab libraries, and also needs the LucretiaMain and LucretiaMatlab
libraries to build.&nbsp; Set this up by selecting Settings from the
Project menu.&nbsp; In the window that appears, select the desired DLL
from the list on the LHS, and "All configurations" from the "Settings
For" pulldown menu.&nbsp; On the RHS select the "C/C++" tab,
"Preprocessor" from the Category pulldown menu.&nbsp; In the
"Preprocessor definitions:" area, add MATLAB_MEX_FILE, and in the
"Additional include directories" select the Matlab include file
directory discussed for the static libraries.&nbsp; Now select the
"Link" tab and "Input" from the Category pull-down menu.&nbsp; In the
"Object/library modules:" box add LucretiaMain.lib LucretiaMatlab.lib
libmx.lib libmex.lib (library names should be separated by
spaces).&nbsp; In the "Additional library path:" box add the paths to
the correct versions of LucretiaMain and LucretiaMatlab (in my case,
for example, it's:<br>
c:/pt files/nlc and ilc/sw+tools/lucretia/lucretia/LucretiaMain/Release
for the former).&nbsp; Add also the path for the Matlab libraries
libmex and libmx (in my case that's
c:/matlab/MATLAB7/extern/lib/win32/microsoft/msvc60), with semicolons
(;) used to separate the paths entered in this box.<br>
<br>
Note that if you decide to build both release and debug versions of the
libraries you will need to set different paths to the LucretiaMain and
LucretiaMatlab libraries for the two versions of each DLL.&nbsp; Do
this by using either the "Win32 Release" or "Win32 Debug" selections in
the "Settings For" pulldown menu. <br>
<br>
With all that done, all you should need to do is set Matlab's path to
include the location of your DLLs and the location of the Lucretia
m-file functions and scripts, and everything should just work!<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Build:&nbsp; Static Libraries</span><br>
<br>
The Lucretia distribution includes a Makefile for use with gmake to
build the static libraries, which for Solaris are named
libLucretiaMain_sun.a and libLucretiaMatlab_sun.a.&nbsp; You will need
to edit the Makefile and change the MANPATH symbol, which points at the
location I use for the Matlab header files for libLucretiaMatlab_sun.a.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Build:&nbsp; Dynamic Libraries</span><br>
<br>
The Lucretia distribution includes a Matlab script, MakeLucretiaMex.m,
which will automatically build the dynamic libraries GetRmats.mexsol,
GetTwiss.mexsol, RmatAtoB.mexsol, TrackThru.mexsol,
VerifyLattice.mexsol.&nbsp; You may need to first perform mex -setup to
tell Matlab to use the Sun C compiler rather than some other one (such
as lcc, which is bundled with Matlab).&nbsp; <br>
