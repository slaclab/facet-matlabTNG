As described on the <a href="beam.html">beams</a> webpage, a Lucretia
beam consists of an arbitrary number of bunches, each bunch can contain
an arbitrary number and distribution of rays, and each ray can have any
desired amount of charge.&nbsp; This gives the user total flexibility
in selecting a representation which is optimal for their particular
application.<br>

<br>

Lucretia support for beam generation includes tools for generating a
syntactically-correct but otherwise blank beam, as well as tools for
generating some of the more typical distributions.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="CheckBeamMomenta"></a>CheckBeamMomenta:</span><br>

<br>

Check that all of the momenta in a generated beam are physically
meaningful.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; BeamOut =
CheckBeamMomenta( BeamIn )<br>

<br>

takes as its calling argument a beam data structure, BeamIn.&nbsp; For
each ray in each bunch in the beam, the total momentum is checked (it
must be &gt; 0), and the transverse momentum is checked (it must be
&lt; 1).&nbsp; Any ray which has a bad momentum, according to these
criteria, has its "stop" parameter set in the beam which is returned to
the calling function as BeamOut.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="CoupledTwissFromInitial"></a>CoupledTwissFromInitial:</span><br>

<br>

Function CoupledTwissFromInitial takes an <a href="#InitCondStruc">initial
conditions data
structure</a> and returns the equivalent data structure of coupled
Twiss parameters.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; C = CoupledTwissFromInitial( Initial0 )<br>

<br>

The returned data structure C is a 6 x 6 x 3 structure of the initial
Twiss parameters of the beam, including coupling, expressed in <a href="http://prst-ab.aps.org/abstract/PRSTAB/v9/i2/e024001">the Wolski
notation</a>.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="CreateBlankBeam"></a>CreateBlankBeam:</span><br>

<br>

Generate a beam which is syntactically correct but otherwise blank,
according to certain user specifications.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = CreateBlankBeam(
nbunch, nrays, P0, interval )<br>

<br>

creates a beam with nbunch bunches, nrays rays per bunch, and an
inter-bunch time of interval.&nbsp; Each ray is instantiated with a
charge of 1.60217653e-19 coulombs (the electron charge magnitude from
the <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2004/reviews/consrpp.pdf">2004 PDG</a>),
and a momentum of P0.&nbsp; The number of rays per bunch is nrays for
each bunch.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="InitCondStruc"></a>InitCondStruc:</span><br>

<br>

Return a blank initial condition structure.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Initial = InitCondStruc( )<br>

<br>

creates a structure with the following fields:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Initial.Momentum:&nbsp; centroid momentum in GeV/c</li>
  <li>Initial.x:&nbsp; horizontal beam parameters</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial.x.NEmit:&nbsp; horizontal normalized emittance in m.rad</li>
    <li>Initial.x.pos:&nbsp; x centroid position in meters</li>
    <li>Initial.x.ang:&nbsp; xz centroid angle in radians</li>
    <li>Initial.x.Twiss:&nbsp; uncoupled horizontal Twiss parameters</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial.x.Twiss.beta:&nbsp; beta_x in meters</li>
      <li>Initial.x.Twiss.alpha:&nbsp; alpha_x<br>
      </li>
      <li>Initial.x.Twiss.eta:&nbsp; horizontal dispersion in meters</li>
      <li>Initial.x.Twiss.etap:&nbsp; horizontal dispersion slope in
meters</li>
      <li>Initial.x.Twiss.nu:&nbsp; horizontal betatron phase in meters</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Initial.y:&nbsp; vertical parameters, same syntax as Initial.x</li>
  <li>Initial.zpos:&nbsp; c * arrival time in meters, zpos &lt; 0 ==
early arrival wrt reference</li>
  <li>Initial.SigPUncorrel:&nbsp; uncorrelated RMS momentum spread in
GeV/c</li>
  <li>Initial.PZCorrel:&nbsp; longitudinally-correlated momentum spread
in GeV/c/m.</li>
  <li>Initial.NBunch:&nbsp; number of bunches</li>
  <li>Initial.BunchInterval:&nbsp; inter-bunch spacing in seconds.</li>
  <li>Initial.Q:&nbsp; bunch charge in Coulombs.</li>
</ul>

By and large the parameters are initialized to zero with the exception
of the twiss parameters, total momentum, number of bunches, and bunch
interval, each of which is initialized to 1; and the bunch charge,
which is initialized to 1.60217653e-19.&nbsp; The Initial structure has
the same fields as the structure returned by <a href="lattice_generation.html#XSIFToLucretia">XSIFToLucretia</a> with
the initial beam parameters obtained from the lattice file.&nbsp; The
Twiss substructures are in the format required by the <a href="twiss.html#GetTwiss">GetTwiss</a> operation, and the Initial
structure is also used by MakeBeam6DGauss, MakeBeam6DSparse,
MakeBeamPZGauss, and MakeBeamPZGrid functions.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeBeam6DGauss"></a>MakeBeam6DGauss:</span><br>

<br>

Generate a beam with bunches that are Gaussian-distributed in
6-dimensional phase space.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeam6DGauss(
Initial, nray, nsigma, allsame )<br>

<br>

generates a beam with nray rays per bunch, in which the ray coordinates
are set by a Gaussian-random distribution with truncation at nsigma
sigmas.&nbsp; Argument nsigma can be a scalar (in which case all 6
degrees of freedom are truncated at the same level) or a vector of
length 6 (in which case the truncation is separately specified for each
DOF).&nbsp; Argument nray can be a scalar (in which case each bunch has
the same number of rays) or a vector of length nbunch (in which case
the different bunches can have different numbers of rays).&nbsp;
Initial is an initial condition structure in the format generated by <a href="#InitCondStruc">InitCondStruc</a>, and the ray distribution
conforms to the parameters of Initial to the limit of statistics.&nbsp;
Each ray has a charge of Initial.Q / nray.&nbsp; If argument allsame ==
1, then one set of rays is generated for bunch 1 and copied to each
additional bunch (ie, each bunch starts with the same distribution of
rays), otherwise each bunch gets a unique set of rays which conform to
the distribution requested in Initial.&nbsp; If allsame == 1, values of
nray(2:end) are ignored (ie, allsame overrides nray in case of a
conflict).<br>

<br>

This is the typical form of a beam distribution in a ray-tracking
program such as DIMAD, MAD, or TURTLE.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeBeam6DSparse"></a>MakeBeam6DSparse:</span><br>

<br>

Generate a sparse beam which conforms to a desired set of beam
parameters.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeam6DSparse(
Initial, nsigmas, nzgrid, npgrid )<br>

<br>

generates a beam in which the rays are distributed according to a grid
in the longitudinal phase plane, with nzgrid grid points in z and
npgrid grid points in P.&nbsp; At each grid point 9 rays are
assigned:&nbsp; one at the nominal centroid orbit, and the remaining 8
at +/- sqrt(9/2) sigmas in each of x, px, y, py.&nbsp; All the rays at
a given grid point have the same charge, but the total charge per grid
point varies according to a Gaussian distribution, with truncation at
nsigmas sigmas; nsigmas can be a scalar or a vector of length 2,
depending on whether truncation should be equal in P and z or
not.&nbsp; The practical upshot of all this is a beam which has first
and second moments which match the Initial structure in all degrees of
freedom, but which achieves that result with relatively few rays
compared to the distribution made by <a href="#MakeBeam6DGauss">MakeBeam6DGauss</a>.&nbsp;
This is an emulation of the "slices and macroparticles" beam typically
used in linac codes such as LIAR.&nbsp; The main disadvantage of the
6DSparse distribution is that its ability to represent non-Gaussian
transverse distributions is almost but not quite nonexistent; on the
other hand, a 6DSparse distribution can be tracked through the lattice
quite quickly compared to a 6DGauss distribution which has enough rays
to accurately represent the beam.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeBeam6DWeighted"></a>MakeBeam6DWeighted</span><br>

<br>

Generate a beam with a uniform random distribution in 6 dimensions with
a gaussian distributed charge weighting. This distribution is helpful
when looking at beam loss along the BEAMLINE for example, where small
beam losses at the tails of the beam distribution are important.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeam6DWeighted(
Initial, nray, nsigma, allsame ) <br>

<br>

returns a beam structure which is similar to the output from <a href="#MakeBeam6DGauss">MakeBeam6DGauss</a>, except that the rays are
distributed according to the Matlab uniform random number distribution
(max +/- nsigma). Argument nsigma can be a scalar (in which case all 6
degrees of freedom are truncated at the same level) or a vector of
length 6 (in which case the truncation is separately specified for each
DOF). The charge of each macro particle is assigned according to a
gaussian distribution. If argument allsame ==
1, then one set of rays is generated for bunch 1 and copied to each
additional bunch (ie, each bunch starts with the same distribution of
rays), otherwise each bunch gets a unique set of rays which conform to
the distribution requested in Initial.&nbsp; If allsame == 1, values of
nray(2:end) are ignored (ie, allsame overrides nray in case of a
conflict).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeBeamPZGauss"></a>MakeBeamPZGauss:</span><br>

<br>

Generate a beam with a Gaussian distribution in the longitudinal
degrees of freedom.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeamPZGauss(
Initial, nsigmas, nray ) <br>

<br>

returns a beam structure which is similar to the output from <a href="beam_generation.html#MakeBeam6DGauss">MakeBeam6DGauss</a>,
except that all
transverse coordinates are set to the desired centroid positions while
the longitudinal coordinates are Gaussian distributed with truncation
at nsigmas; nsigmas can be a scalar or a vector of length 2.&nbsp;
Argument nray is a scalar, which forces each bunch to have the same
number of rays, and each ray has the same charge of Initial.Q /
nray.&nbsp; The P and z coordinate distributions in each bunch are
distinct from one another, not duplicates of one another.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MakeBeamPZGrid"></a>MakeBeamPZGrid:</span><br>

<br>

Generate a beam with zero second moments in the transverse according to
a weighted grid in the longitudinal degrees of freedom.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeamPZGrid(
Initial, nisgmas, nzgrid, npgrid )<br>

<br>

produces a distribution similar to that generated by <a href="#MakeBeam6DSparse">MakeBeam6DSparse</a> except that there is
only 1 ray at each grid point in longitudinal space, and its transverse
coordinates are the desired centroid coordinates in Initial.&nbsp; Thus
the transverse second moments are zero but the longitudinal
distribution matches the requested initial values.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; beam = MakeBeamPZGrid(
Initial, nisgmas, nzgrid, npgrid, nray )<br>

<br>

produces the same ray except with nray equally-charged rays on each
grid point.<br>
