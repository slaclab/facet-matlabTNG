    <h2><strong>ISR</strong></h2>
    <br>
    Lucretia allows the user to simulate incoherent synchrotron
    radiation losses in
    dipole correctors, sector bends, quads, sextupoles, octupoles,
    multipoles, and transverse-mode cavities.&nbsp; During tracking,
    there
    are four possible methods of synchrotron radiation simulation, which
    are determined by the SynRad tracking flag of each element:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 0:</span>&nbsp;
    Synchrotron radiation is completely ignored.&nbsp; This is the
    default
    settting of the SynRad tracking flag for all elements at
    instantiation
    time.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 1:</span>&nbsp;
    For each particle, the mean energy loss from synchrotron radiation
    is
    calculated, taking into account the particle's momentum and the
    actual
    field that it encounters (ie, particles which are far from the
    center
    of a quad or other multipole magnet will have larger losses than
    particles which are near the center of the magnet).&nbsp; Half of
    the
    loss is applied at the upstream face of the element (ie, before
    tracking), and half at the downstream face of the element (ie, after
    tracking).&nbsp; In this way, the effect of the energy variation on
    the
    particle's trajectory is approximately taken into account.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 2:</span>&nbsp;
    For each particle, both the mean and the quantum-fluctuation
    components
    of the synchrotron radiation are calculated.&nbsp; This is
    accomplished
    by computing the photon critical energy (u_c) and mean number of
    photons emitted (nphot) for each particle; for each particle
    generating
    a Poisson-distribued random number with mean nphot to indicate the
    actual number of photons emitted; and finally generating the actual
    energy of each photon emitted by each particle according to the
    incoherent synchrotron radiation spectrum.&nbsp; As with the
    previous
    option, half the energy loss is applied pre-tracking and half is
    applied post-tracking; the opening angle of the photon is
    ignored.&nbsp; The spectrum generation uses a fast method developed
    by
    A. Wolski; this method agrees very well with the
    analytically-expected
    mean particle energy loss, and produces a spectrum of particle
    energy
    losses which is a few percent wider than the analytically-expected
    one.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.SynRad == 3:</span>&nbsp;
    Both the mean and quantum-fluctuation components of the synchrotron
    radiation are calculated in exactly the method described above,
    except
    that the generation of the photons uses H. Burkhardt's method.&nbsp;
    In
    this case both the mean and the standard deviation of the particle
    energy loss agree with the analytically-expected values to within
    statistical errors, but the method is much slower than Wolski's.<br>
    <br>
    Methods 2 and 3 make use of Matlab's flat-distributed random number
    generator, rand, in the generation of the Poisson-distributed random
    numbers and also in the generation of the photon energies.&nbsp; All
    of
    the methods make the thin-lens approximation:&nbsp; the magnetic
    field
    experienced by a particle at the upstream face of an element, along
    with its effective length, are assumed to be all that is needed to
    compute the emitted radiation.&nbsp; Put another way, the fact that
    the
    particle changes its transverse offset in a quad or other multipole
    magnet, and thus changes the magnetic field that it samples as it
    passes through the element, is ignored.&nbsp; If this is deemed to
    be
    critical to correctly computing the synchrotron radiation, and its
    effects on the beam dynamics, one can divide the magnets into
    longitudinal slices which will more accurately emulate thin lens
    elements for this purpose.<br>
    <br>
    The <a href="momentum_profile.html">momentum profile</a> tools will
    also change their behavior based on the SynRad track flag:&nbsp; if
    SynRad != 0, the
    mean SR loss will be included in the momentum profile for bends,
    correctors, TCAVs, and multipoles with a nonzero dipole field.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><strong>CSR</strong></h2>
    Both a 1d and 2d (in z and bend plane)
    implementation of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation is supported. The
    default is to use the 1d formalism unless the 2d option is switched
    on
    using the CSR_2D tracking flag. The 2d calculation is only for the
    steady-state wakes inside bend magnets, the 1d formalism is used to
    calculate the transient effects at the magnet edges still.<br>
    <br>
    The implementation of 1d CSR in Lucretia uses the formulism
    developed in the paper by G. Stupakov and P. Emma in the EPAC2002
    paper "<a
      href="http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/e02/PAPERS/WEPRI029.pdf">CSR
      Wake for a Short Magnet in Ultrarelativistic Limit</a>". The
    implementation in Lucretia closely follows the method by which CSR
    was implemented in<a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/manuals/elegant_latest/elegant.pdf">
      Elegant</a>. The Elegant implementation very well described
    measurement data taken during the commissioning of LCLS. The
    implementation here has been cross-checked against the example case
    in the Stupakov/Emma paper. It has also been cross-checked against
    Elegant for the specific case of FACET at SLAC.<br>
    <br>
    CSR can be turned on through the use of the BEAMLINE <strong>TrackFlags.CSR
    </strong>field (see below) on an SBEN element. When the tracking
    engine reaches an SBEN element with CSR track flag set, it slices up
    the element (according to defaults specified below), tracks through
    each slice and calculates an energy loss per beam slice (beam
    longitudinal slices also setable by user), applies the energy loss
    and continues. Upon exiting from the bend, further elements are also
    optionally split with the CSR field applied as calculated from the
    preceding bend. The cutoff distance from the bend for application of
    CSR effects is determined as per the description in the
    Stupakov/Emma paper. CSR effects are considered in all elements
    downstream from the bend up to the cutoff with the exception of RF
    and other bend elements. The CSR calculation relies upon a Matlab
    function which resides inside the src/Tracking directory
    (applyCSR.m) which should exist on your Matlab search path.<br>
    <br>
    The 2d steady-state CSR fields are calculated according to Y. Cai:
    PR-AB 23, 014402 (2020). Their use requires ellipic integral
    functions
    included in the utils/ directory of Lucretia and requires them to be
    on
    the Matlab search path. The 2d field equations are much slower to
    calculate than the 1d equivalents and should only be used when
    necessary. As a guideline, 1d calculations should be sufficient if
    sigma_x * (1/R*sigma_z^2)^(1/3)&nbsp; &lt;&lt; 1, where R is the
    bend
    radius. If using the 2d option, it is suggested to start with the
    default options and a low number of bins (say &lt;30) and slices
    (say,
    2), then examine the 2d gridding performance and calculation time
    using
    the Diagnostics tracking flag set to true.<br>
    <br>
    CSR tracking options (set through TrackFlag field on SBEN elements
    in BEAMLINE array, default values shown):<br>
    <strong><br>
      TrackFlag.CSR = 0</strong><br>
    A setting of 0 means no CSR tracking to take place. An integer value
    &gt;0 switches on CSR effects in the corresponding SBEN element. The
    integer value set indicates the number of longitudinal slices
    (histogram bins) to use for the beam description in the CSR
    calculation. The optimal number depends upon the topology and number
    of macro particles within the tracked bunch. It is always advised to
    experiment with this setting to find a value which produces stable
    results without too much of a time overhead.<br>
    If TrackFlag.CSR = -1 then the CSR algorithm automatically
    calculates
    the number of bins to use based on the number of macro particles and
    the distribution (using either the Matlab histcounts or histcounts2
    algorithm- see Matlab documentation for details).<br>
    For 2d caclulations, the CSR setting determines the number of bins
    in
    both planes unless the CSR_2D_NX flag is set in which case this flag
    sets the number of bins in the Z dimension.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TrackFlag.CSR_SmoothFactor = 0<br>
    </strong>The
    longitudinal charge profile is smoothed after binning. This
    parameter
    (integer &gt;= 0) controls the degree of smoothing. The optimal
    value
    depends upon the number of bins used (.CSR field above) and the
    'spikiness' of the longitudinal beam profile. The larger the value,
    the
    more smoothing is applied. See "help smoothn" for more details on
    the
    smotthing algorithm used.<br>
    If SmoothFactor = 0: the smoothing algorithm automatically
    determines
    the smoothing parameter to apply (see "help smoothn" for more
    details-
    the 'robust' smoothing option is applied in this case).<br>
    To apply no smoothing, select a SmoothFactor of 1.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TrackFlag.Split</strong> =
    <strong>10<br>
    </strong>The number of slices to split the SBEN element into. This
    tracking flag is also independent of the CSR fields, it can be set
    independently- in which case the tracking engine treats the element
    as N sequential identical elements with lengths and strengths scaled
    appropriately. More splitting more closely represents reality but
    will slow down the tracking.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>
      TrackFlag.CSR_DriftSplit = 10<br>
    </strong>If set to 0, then no CSR treatment is applied beyond the
    downstream face of the SBEN. If integer &gt;0, then CSR is applied
    to the tracked beam downstream of the bend to a point downstream
    determined internally where the CSR field ceases to have a
    significant effect. The following elements are usually drifts (hence
    the flag name, but can include any element class other than LCAV or
    TCAV). The value of the CSR_DriftSplit flag determines the number of
    slices between the downstream SBEN face and the cutoff point to use.
    Depending on the number of downstream elements between bend and
    cutoff point, the elements are split so that the total number of
    tracking slices is at least this value. Note if the tracking engine
    encounters another SBEN element before the cutoff distance, it
    simply stops the calculation and starts again with the new SBEN (if
    CSR switched on in this bend), no effort is made to convolve the CSR
    fields from multiple bends. The slices are made according to a
    logarithmic distribution, with more slices closer to the bend where
    the CSR fields are changing most rapidly. A value of &gt;50 is
    recommended and experimentation suggested.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.CSR_USEGPU = false<br>
    </span>Use GPU for CSR calculations to speed up computation time.
    Currently only supported for 2D calculation. Requires NVidia GPU
    with
    compute capability &gt;=2.0 and CUDA 8.0+ installed and Matlab
    Parallel
    Toolbox.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.Diagnostics = false<br>
    </span>Switch on diagnostics output and plots if Diagnostics=true.
    Shows intermediate details of CSR calculation for helping in
    determining optimal CSR parameter settings.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.CSR_2D = 0<br>
    </span>Perform 2D CSR calculation if =1 for steady-state case inside
    bend magnet.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.CSR_2D_NX = []<br>
    </span>If this flag is defined, then use this number of bins in the
    X
    (or bend plane) dimension, then the number of bins in the Z
    dimension
    is set by the CSR flag. If not set, then the number of bins is
    either
    set automatically (if CSR=-1) or with the number of bins set in the
    CSR
    flag in both dimensions.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">TrackFlag.CSR_2D_GSCALE = [1 1]<br>
    </span>Scales granularity of 2d grids used for wake calculations. To
    perform the requried 2d overlap integral, the problem is subdivided
    into a number of sub-grids to optimize the compute time by providing
    higher-detail grids for the portions of the 2d integral with
    fast-changing wake potentials. The gridding requirements change non
    trivially with bend angle, beam energy and bunch distributions. The
    CSR
    algorithm attempts to sensibly auto-scale the integral grids, but a
    specific problem may benefit from finer gridding or speed up without
    accuracy loss with coarser gridding depending on the specifics.<br>
    The first GSCALE element scales the number of grids used for the
    fine-detail areas of the 2d integration.<br>
    The second GSCALE element scales the number of grids used for the
    coarser areas of the 2d integration.<br>
    The computation time scales approximately as the square of each
    GSCALE element.<br>
