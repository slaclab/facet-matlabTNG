<small>Internal Arrangement of the Mexfiles<br>
<br>
</small></span></div>

Most of the fun stuff in Lucretia is in the form of individual m-files
that are, on the whole, pretty simple.&nbsp; The mexfiles which do the
CPU-intensive tracking, Twiss and Rmat calculations, and lattice
verifications are another matter.&nbsp; Documentation of the mexfile
inner workings can be found below. Any shared object file dependencies
of the mexfiles are included in the Lucretia distribution in the
src/Libs directories. You should esnure that these files are included
in your shared libs search path (e.g. include in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable under Linux).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Static Libraries:&nbsp; LucretiaMain
and LucretiaMatlab</span><br>

<br>

Static library LucretiaMain contains all of the actual accelerator
physics and simulation algorithms.&nbsp; LucretiaMain is further
divided into 2 main source files, LucretiaCommon.c and
LucretiaPhysics.c.&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.c contains all of the logic
which is used in the Twiss, Rmat, verification, and tracking
operations:&nbsp; looping over elements and bunches, dynamic allocation
and deallocation, stopping particles, etc.&nbsp; LucretiaPhysics.c is
almost pure accelerator physics:&nbsp; calculation of transfer maps,
propagation of Twiss functions through a transfer map, etc.&nbsp; I
would be the first to admit that the line is somewhat blurry:&nbsp; is
splining of wake functions more like logic or like physics?&nbsp; Is
the combination of an element's offsets with its girder's offsets more
like logic or like physics?&nbsp; I put the former in LucretiaPhysics
and the Latter in LucretiaCommon.<br>

<br>

In any event, LucretiaMain does not require any Matlab support to
build.&nbsp; It does require several include files, however:<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h (data type definitions and function
prototypes for LucretiaCommon.c)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaPhysics.h (constants and function prototypes
for LucretiaPhysics.c)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaDictionary.h (definitions of parameters for
elements, wakefields, klystrons, etc)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVerifyMsg.h (definitions of various text
strings used in lattice verification messages)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVersionProto.h (function prototypes for
getting version information)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h (function prototypes for
requesting information from Matlab).<br>

<br>

Static library LucretiaMatlab contains all the functions which are used
to access Matlab's dataspace and built-in functions (random number
generation, cubic spline, etc).&nbsp; Almost all of LucretiaMatlab's
functions are in LucretiaMatlab.c; a small number of functions related
to the status-and-message stack for the mexfiles is in
LucretiaMatlabErrMsg.c.&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab will not compile without
two Matlab include files, mex.h and matrix.h.&nbsp; It also needs the
following include files:<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaCommon.h<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaGlobalAccess.h<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaVersionProto.h<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LucretiaMatlab.h (function prototypes for
LucretiaMatlab.c and LucretiaMatlabErrMsg.c).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic Libraries:&nbsp; GetRmats,
GetTwiss, RmatAtoB, TrackThru, VerifyLattice</span><br>

<br>

The mexfile functions use the somewhat-awkward Matlab standard
protocols for communicating with Matlab:&nbsp; there is a function file
(for example, GetRmats.c) which contains a gateway function (which must
have the name MexFunction); MexFunction performs all of the interfacing
between Matlab (which calls MexFunction) and the actual working
functions of Lucretia mexfiles (which are called by MexFunction).&nbsp;
<br>

<br>

In each of the mexfiles, the C file which contains MexFunction also
contains other routines related to unpacking arguments and general
preparation for simulation work, packing results in Matlab data
structures, and miscellaneous cleanup.&nbsp; No other functionality is
coded in the mexfile C files.&nbsp; Each of the mexfiles requires mex.h
and matrix.h from Matlab as well as LucretiaCommon.h, LucretiaMatlab.h,
and LucretiaGlobalAccess.h in order to build, and they must also link
against the LucretiaMain and LucretiaMatlab static libraries.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Static Libraries:&nbsp; g4track<br>
</span><br>

This static library is built using the c++ source and Makefile in the
src/mexsrc/g4track directory. This build process requires the presence
of the GEANT4 source code installed with all Material files databases
in the standard way (in particlular the geant4-config script must also
be on the PATH). To use the GEANT4 calling functionality of Lucretia,
TrackThru must be built against this library using the "make g4track"
build option in the main Lucretia build area.<br>
