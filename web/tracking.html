<small>Tracking<br>
<br>
</small></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Tracking beams composed of bunches which
are in turn composed of rays is the heart of Lucretia.&nbsp; All
Lucretia tracking is accomplished by the mexfile function TrackThru.<br>There 
	are 2 ways of handling tracking within Lucretia, either directly 
	through function calls to <a href="#TrackThru">TrackThru</a>, or through the 
	Lucretia <a href="#Track">Track</a> class. Using the simple TrackThru 
	command is the most straight-forward approach and is generally what you will 
	want to use. The main advantage of the Track class is that it supports 
	parallel tracking across multiple hosts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="TrackThru"></a>TrackThru:</span><br>
<br>
The syntax for the generic tracking command is:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1,
elem2, beamin, bunch1, bunch2 )<br>
<br>
which takes an initial beam (beamin), tracks bunches bunch1 through
bunch2 inclusive through elements elem1 through elem2 inclusive, and
puts the resulting beam in beamout, and also returns a status cell
array stat (see <a href="beam.html">here</a> for more on beams, <a
 href="beam_generation.html">here</a> for tools useful for beam
generation,
and <a href="function_status.html">here</a> for information on status
cell arrays).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The command syntax above will track all bunches from bunch1 through
bunch2 through element elem1 before tracking bunch1 through elem1+1,
followed by bunch1+1 through elem1+1, etc.&nbsp; This is known as
element-wise tracking.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If bunch1 != 1, then beamout.Bunch(1) will be the result of tracking
beamin.Bunch(bunch1), beamout.Bunch(2) will hold the tracking results
from beamin.Bunch(bunch1+1), etc -- in other words, the output bunches
will not be put into the same slots in beamout that they occupy in
beamin.<br>
<br>
Successful tracking will yield stat{1} == 1, and no messages.&nbsp; If
stat{1} == 0, this typically means that a serious failure occurred in
tracking, for example an element with invalid fields of some form such
as a zero-length quad.&nbsp; A value of stat{1} == -1 indicates that
some rays could not be tracked through the full range of elem1 to
elem2:&nbsp; causes of stoppage include hitting an&nbsp; aperture which
was turned on via its Aper <a href="element_classes.html#TrackFlag">tracking
flag</a>, a ray whose trajectory has been bent perpendicular to the
accelerator axis, or a ray which has been decelerated to zero by an RF
structure.&nbsp; A bunch in which all rays are lost will generate a
BUNCHSTOP message in the stat array.&nbsp; To see where a ray got lost,
use the beamout.Bunch().stop vector to see which element stopped the
ray; at the time of stopping, the ray's coordinates will be
frozen.&nbsp; Note that these rays are in the reference frame of the
element, so the ray coordinates which are preserved at the time of
stopping may be offset and/or rotated with respect to the accelerator
survey line.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Element-wise Versus Bunch-wise
Tracking:</span><br>
<br>
The command syntax above, as was mentioned, will generate element-wise
tracking in which all bunches are tracked through a given element
before any bunch is tracked through the next element (for
code-geeks:&nbsp; the bunch loop is the inner loop, the element loop is
the outer loop).&nbsp; It is also possible to select bunch-wise
tracking which performs the operations in the opposite order.&nbsp;
This is selected by adding a sixth argument to the TrackThru call,
which is zero for element-wise tracking and one for bunch-wise:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1,
elem2, beamin, bunch1, bunch2, 0 ) % element-wise again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1,
elem2, beamin, bunch1, bunch2, 1 ) % bunch-wise<br>
<br>
What are the differences between bunch-wise and element-wise tracking?<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>In element-wise tracking, Lucretia deletes any multibunch
information in elements elem1 through elem2 inclusive at the beginning
and the end of tracking.&nbsp; This includes long range wake kicks from
previous bunches, as well as variations in the energy gain from bunch
to bunch if the bunch spacing is not matched to the RF frequency.&nbsp;
In essence, each tracking operation in element-wise mode is assumed to
be a new bunch train which enters long after the last train (tracked on
the last TrackThru operation) is passed.</li>
  <li>By contrast, in bunch-wise tracking Lucretia preserves the
multibunch information in the elements between TrackThru
operations.&nbsp; If the command sequence:</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 1,
1, 1 ) ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 2,
2, 1 ) ;<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">is executed, bunch 2 will experience
the wake kick from bunch 1 (if any), and will experience an incorrect
energy gain if beamin.BunchInterval is not matched to the RF
frequency.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>During bunch-wise tracking, Lucretia will clear multibunch
information from a given element if a bunch is tracked through that
element which has a bunch number which is &lt;= the number of the last
bunch tracked through that element.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 1,
1, 1 ) ;&nbsp; % bunch-wise&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 2,
2, 1 ) ;&nbsp; % mb info preserved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 2,
2, 1 ) ;&nbsp; % mb info deleted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout] = TrackThru( elem1, elem2, beamin, 1,
1, 1 ) ;&nbsp; % mb info deleted<br>
<ul>
  <li>In bunch-wise tracking, Lucretia has to allocate data tables to
keep track of the amplitude and phase of every mode in each structure
which is bunch-wise tracked.&nbsp; This makes bunch-wise tracking
slower and more memory-intensive than element-wise tracking.</li>
  <li>If it is necessary to force Lucretia to recognize a new TrackThru
operation as a new train (ie, I just did bunches 1 to 10 and now I want
to do 20 to 30 but I want the new track to be a new train), the command
syntax:</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TrackThru('clear')<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">will delete all multibunch information.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Obtaining Instrument Readings:</span><br>
<br>
In general the user will not be content to track a beam from one point
to another and see the resulting distribution; generally we want to get
some BPM readings, beam size measurements, etc.&nbsp; To do this, we
can add a third return argument to TrackThru to capture the instrument
data:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [stat,beamout,instdata] = TrackThru(
elem1, elem2, beamin, bunch1, bunch2, flag ) ;<br>
<br>
Return variable instdata is a 1 x 3 cell array, with contents as
follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">instdata{1} is a structure array (ie
instdata{1}(1), instdata{1}(2), etc) containing BPM readings.&nbsp; The
readings are generated at any BPM between elem1 and elem2 inclusive
which had either its GetBPMData or its GetBPMBeamPars <a
 href="element_classes.html#TrackFlag">tracking flags</a> set.&nbsp;
The fields in instdata{1} are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Index:&nbsp; index into BEAMLINE of this BPM</li>
  <li>S:&nbsp; S position of the BPM</li>
  <li>Pmod:&nbsp; design momentum at the BPM (from BEAMLINE{}.P)</li>
  <li>x: horizontal BPM reading taking into account offsets, rotations,
electrical offsets, and BPM resolution</li>
  <li>y: vertical BPM reading taking into account all the same things
as in x.</li>
  <li>z: phase error of beam (in m) at the BPM</li>
  <li>P:&nbsp; actual centroid momentum of the beam at the BPM.</li>
  <li>sigma:&nbsp; second-moment matrix of the beam at the BPM.</li>
</ul>
If the GetBPMBeamPars for a BPM is set to zero, then z, P, and sigma
are empty for that BPM (ie, the BPM returns only data that you could
really get from the BPM).&nbsp; If the BPM's MultiBunch flag is zero,
then x, y, z, and P are scalars, sigma is 6 x 6, and x, y, z, P, sigma
are computed for the bunch train as a whole.&nbsp; If instead
MultiBunch == 1, then x, y, z, and P are vectors with 1 value per
bunch, and sigma is a 3-d matrix, 6 x 6 x nbunch.&nbsp; Also, note that
the rays in a beam are defined with their 6th coordinate as total
momentum in GeV/c.&nbsp; This dimension is preserved in the sigma
matrix, so for example sigma(1,6) has units of m.GeV/C, sigma(6,6) has
units GeV^2/c^2, etc.<br>
<br>
instdata{2} is a structure array of information generated at all
instruments (including elements of class INST, WIRE, PROF, BLMO, SLMO,
IMON), with the following fields<br>
<ul>
  <li>Index: index into BEAMLINE</li>
  <li>S:&nbsp; S position.</li>
  <li>x:&nbsp; beam horizontal position, taking into account offsets
and rotations of the element</li>
  <li>sig11:&nbsp; sigma_x^2, taking into account rotations of the
element</li>
  <li>y:&nbsp; beam vertical position, taking into account offsets and
rotations of the element</li>
  <li>sig33:&nbsp; sigma_y^2, taking into account rotations of the
element</li>
  <li>sig13:&nbsp; sigma_xy, taking into account rotations of the
element</li>
  <li>z:&nbsp; beam arrival phase error * c, taking into account
offsets of the element</li>
  <li>sig55:&nbsp; sig_z^2.</li>
</ul>
Only instruments with their GetInstData tracking flag set will return
non-empty data.&nbsp; As with BPMs, these values can be either scalars
or 1 x nbunch vectors depending on the setting of each instrument's
MultiBunch tracking flag.<br>
<br>
instdata{3} is a structure array containing data from RF structure
higher-order mode BPMs, with the following fields:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Index: index into BEAMLINE</li>
  <li>S:&nbsp; S position.</li>
  <li>x:&nbsp; beam horizontal position, taking into account offsets
and rotations of the element as well as resolution limits and
electrical offsets.<br>
  </li>
  <li>y:&nbsp; beam vertical position, taking into account offsets and
rotations of the element as well as resolution limits and electrical
offsets.</li>
</ul>
Only LCAVs with their GetSBPMData flags set to 1 will return
data.&nbsp; HOM BPMs do not support multibunch data; HOM BPM readings
in Lucretia are always for the full train.<br><br>How does Lucretia model the resolution of BPMs and HOM-BPMs?&nbsp; The
resolution limit is modelled by throwing a Gaussian-distributed random
number, multiplying it by the resolution figure, and adding the
resulting product to the beam position.&nbsp; The random number is
generated by the Matlab randn function, so resetting randn will also
reset the generation of BPM noise errors.<br><br><br>

	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Version Information:</span><br><br>The TrackThru mexfile requires several different components to build
properly.&nbsp; To see the version of each component used in your
version of TrackThru, type<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; TrackThru('version')</div>
	<strong><br><a name="Track"></a>Track Class:<br><br></strong>As always, type &quot;help Track&quot; for 
	help within Matlab, or as with all Lucretia classes, &quot;doc<strong> </strong>Track&quot; 
	will give you more information about the class properties and methods 
	available to you.<strong><br></strong>TRACK is a Lucretia beam tracking 
	interface.<br>It works in conjunction with the TrackThru mexfile to perform 
	tracking, either single-threaded or on a distributed Lucretia interface defined by 
	an optionally passed distributedLucretia object on construction. It is only 
	through this class that parallel tracking operations are supported.<br><br>
The idea within the context of Distributed Lucretia here is that you first setup 
multiple BEAMLINE environments with the distributedLucretia class, then define 
an input beam which will be tracked in parallel across all BEAMLINE definitions 
(or define multiple beams if you want each BEAMLINE environment to track with a 
different beam input).<br><br>
	It supports both asynchronous and synchronous parallel tracking (set in 
	distributedLucretia class passed to this object upon creation). Asynchronous 
	is slower to run than synchronous due to extra setup time but the trackThru 
	command returns immediately which is useful if you want to process other 
	commands serially whilst the parallel tracking is being computed.<br><br>
	Contructor:<br>
	<blockquote>
		T=<strong>Track</strong>(InputBeam,distributedLucretiaObject)</blockquote>
	(Omit distributedLucretiaObject if using this object in a non-parallel 
	environment)<br>Must provide &quot;InputBeam&quot;, a Lucretia Beam structure.<br><br>Main public methods: <br>
	<ul>
	<li>trackThru - main tracking
	method, this runs TrackThru using the properties set within the Track object 
	you created.</ul>
<br>Main public properties:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>startInd: Finish tracking index
		<li>finishInd: Start tracking index
		<li>firstBunch: first bunch to track(if multibunch) [defaults to 1]
		<li>lastBunch: last bunch to track (if multibunch) [defaults to 1]
		<li>loopFlag: loop over elements (0) or over bunches (1) [defaults to 0]
		<li>beamType: 0=all input beams the same, 1=possibly different beams for each worker [defaults to 0]
		<li>beamIn: Lucretia beam structure to track (passed upon object creation). 
		Single beam definition or cell with multiple definitions.<li>instrData: (distributed) instrument data from tracking
        <li>beamOut: (distributed) beam object post tracking
        <li>trackStatus: (distributed) Lucretia status from tracking
	</ul>
The properties with (distributed) labels are (in the Distributed Lucretia 
context) actualy Matlab Distributed class objects. That is they don't have 
locally assigned values, the data exists either in a shared file location (if in 
asynchronous mode) or in the memory of the worker node systems (if in 
synchronous mode). When you examine the data by e.g. beamOut{N} where N is the 
worker node id, the data is automatically retrieved and given to you. Note the 
distributed variables here are the output variables from TrackThru on each 
worker node (with potentially different beamline descriptions).<br><br>
	Example:<br>%Create a distributedLucretia object (choose synchronicity with<br>
	isasyn=true|false)<br>DL=distributedLucretia(isasyn)<br>% Create Track 
	object with a Lucretia InputBeam<br>T=Track(InputBeam,DL) % Now set track 
	indices, T.startInd,T.finishInd etc as desired<br>% Make any lattice changes<br>
	DL.latticeSyncVals(1).PS(53)=0.85;<br>DL.latticeSyncVals(2).PS(53)=0.85;<br>
