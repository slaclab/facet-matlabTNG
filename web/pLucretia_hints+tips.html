This is a place for general comments on parallel coding in the Matlab 
environment, I'll put more stuff here as I come across it. This is also a place 
for examples of use of parallel coding using Lucretia, please email any 
experience you have with this to me.<p>

giving an introduction to parallel computing terminology and concepts.</a><br>

Good practices for writing parallel code under the Matlab environment:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First, write good efficient serial code and use the Matlab
	<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/profile.html&http://www.mathworks.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/search/?db=MSS&prox=page&rorder=750&rprox=750&rdfreq=500&rwfreq=500&rlead=250&sufs=0&order=r&is">
	profiler</a> to identify the slowest pieces.</li>
	<li>It is easy to identify parallelisable pieces of code, it is much harder 
	to identify parts that are going to actually run faster when parallelised. 
	There is always a fixed overhead to parallelising a piece of code, because 
	invariably you will need to broadcast data to the parallel worker nodes and 
	collect data back on the master node. Obviously, the overhead time should be 
	short with respect to the processing time per node. This will depend on the 
	number and size of data types you need to share (you should work hard to 
	ensure that no more data passing than is strictly necessary happens) as well 
	as the nature of the physical interconnects between your processing nodes. 
	There are also start-up costs to think about, usually once-off transactions, 
	where services are started up on worker nodes and data buffers are 
	initialised etc.</li>
	<li>When you start to to parallelise code parts, it is a good idea to code 
	in a way that enables you to disable or scale the degree of parallelisation. 
	So, you should have an environment variable that enables the simulation to 
	be run as the original serial case, and with a variable number of compute 
	nodes for the parallel version. This enables you to check the parallel 
	speed-up and how this scales with the number of nodes.</li>
	<li>To speed test your code changes, first run with 1 node (the serial case) 
	and check that your code changes haven't by themselves slowed down the 
	simulation. Then check with progressively more compute nodes to see how the 
	simulation time scales. Without heroic efforts, the best you can hope for is 
	to achieve a linear speed up with number of compute nodes used. And most of 
	the time, this isn't achievable. Depending on the specific network 
	architecture your compute nodes sit on, there will be a saturation point 
	where adding nodes to your parallelisation problem doesn't increase the 
	speed of execution any more. Understanding where you start to get 
	diminishing returns from adding processors to a parallel problem is 
	important so you don't waste resources, especially if you are distributing 
	separate instances of the parallel code.</li>
	<li>Whenever you make ANY change to your code, no matter how insignificant, 
	always go through the process of speed testing to check you haven't slowed 
	the simulation down. It is much easier and quicker to catch bugs that may 
	creep in at this stage than later after your code has been deployed on a 
	larger scale.</li>
	<li>I'll say it again because you probably didn't believe me the first time, 
	always, ALWAYS do the speed test after ANY code change- you will thank me in 
	the end.</li>
	<li>Some methods of parallelising your code require the entry point to be a 
	Matlab function and not a script,&nbsp; scripts can be called from within 
	this or other nested functions, but the main routine itself must be a 
	function. Note, this can have consequences for any other parts of your code 
	which may rely on variables being declared in the base Matlab workspace (for 
	example Simulink code that uses Matlab variables- you should pass these as 
	globals instead in this circumstance).</li>
	<li>If you are running parallel jobs which write their results out as a 
	file, be warned that you may run into problems with large numbers of jobs 
	simultaneously trying to write files to the same directory or filesystem, 
	filesystems such as NFS get easily overloaded causing unpredictable results. 
	There are such things as parallel file systems, but unless one is being 
	maintained for you this may constitute a lot of work to put in place 
	depending on your level of computing expertise. One work-around if you find 
	this to be a problem is to institute directory blocking in your code 
	whenever a write action is performed such that only one task can write to 
	disk at any time (or some other reduced number). How much of an impact this 
	has on your code depends on the ratio of time a task is writing to disk 
	compared to running.</li>
	<li>From R2007a, Matlab is now multi-threaded. An increasing number of the 
	built-in functions are taking advantage of this. If you have a multi-core 
	processor you can take advantage of this by switching on the multithreading 
	(off by default) under <i>file&gt;preferences&gt;general:multithreading</i>. 
	Experiment with changing the number of cores used if you have more than 2- 
	be aware, under some circumstances having multithreading switched on doesn't 
	help, and can even make the performance of your simulation worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an example in the <a href="pLucretia_dct.html">DCT/DCE section</a> 
of the steps taken to parallelise Lucretia tracking for an ILC simulation that 
provides some insight into the parallelisation process.</p>
