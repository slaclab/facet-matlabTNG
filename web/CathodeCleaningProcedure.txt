1) Gun RF power OFF
2) Laser off - get CCD background image
3) Insert Faraday cup / prepare for charge measurement
4) Reconfigure laser optics for cleaning
 - open shaping iris
 - reduce laser spot size = 118 um FWHM
 - Tune iris to optimize laser image quality
 - Check laser pointing stability, should be <10% FWHM spot size
5) Note starting vacuum level
6) Laser ON
  - Initial energy = 170 uJ
  - Rep. Rate = 30 Hz
  - Pulse width = 3ps FWHM
7) Select cleaning area using GUI
  - Use illuminated cathode image or past QE map as guide
8) Set cleaning laser energy
  - Move laser spoy outside "clean" area
  - Increase laser energy slowly until vacuum rise 10% above initial noted in (5)
  - Return laser spot to center of cleaning area
  - Close laser shutter
9) Set laser energy operating range = +/- 10% from set point (used in watchdog)
10) Set # pulses per cleaning step = 3
11) Set step size = 1.3 * FHWM laser pulse width (90% of Gaussian peak)
12) Laser rep rate = 30 Hz
13) Mover laser spot position to start (x,y coordinates)
  - This should alternate between top and bottom of cleaning area (enforced by GUI)
14) Start watchdog (EPICS) (GUI sends laser energy and vacuum watch limits)
15) Open laser shutter
16) Set motor velocity [ step size * (rep.rate / pulse per step) ]
17) Start moving across line (set dx absolute motor move)
18) Monitor conditions during move
  - Laser energy in range?
  - Gun vacuum within limits?
  - Laser spot at anticipated location?
  - Is EPICS watchdog program still running?
  - If any of above false => insert shutter, issue GUI warning dialog, stop autoclean program (remember progress for user commanded restart)
  - Write to EPICS watchdog userProc PV to inform watchdog that Matlab software still alive and running
19) Check if still moving across current line
  - if yes, loop to (18)
  - if no, line finished => close shutter, move to start of next line
    - all lines finished?
      - if yes, stop
      - if no, loop to (14)
20) Generate QE map
21) Ave QE<5e-5 | uniformity >10% ?
  - Yes, then increase laser energy by 1 uJ, loop to (8)
  - No, then done. Make log entry (history kept by cleaning GUI).
